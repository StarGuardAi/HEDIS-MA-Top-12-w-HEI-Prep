## 🎯 Deployment Options

### Option A: Dashboard Only (Recommended)
**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Cost:** FREE  
**Impact:** HIGH  
**What:** Deploy Streamlit dashboard to Streamlit Cloud

**Why:** Recruiters want to see a working demo, not API endpoints. The dashboard shows everything: models, predictions, ROI, Star Ratings, visualizations.

**Use Case:**
- Quick portfolio demonstration
- LinkedIn profile link
- Resume portfolio link
- Interview talking point

---

### Option B: Dashboard + API
**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Cost:** FREE  
**Impact:** VERY HIGH  
**What:** Deploy Streamlit + Railway API

**Why:** Shows full-stack capabilities. Dashboard + working API = complete system. Impresses technical recruiters.

**Use Case:**
- Full technical demonstration
- API-first companies
- Senior roles requiring architecture knowledge
- "Show me your work" interviews

---

### Option C: Local Demo Only
**Time:** 0 minutes (already done)  
**Cost:** FREE  
**Impact:** LOW  
**What:** Run locally, show in interview

**Why:** No deployment needed, but limits reach. Can't share with recruiters proactively.

**Use Case:**
- Technical interviews (screen share)
- Can't deploy to cloud (company restrictions)
- Want to iterate before making public

## 🆘 Quick Help

**Deployment fails?**
1. Check requirements.txt has all dependencies
2. Try removing model loading (use synthetic data only)
3. Simplify to 3-4 key pages first
4. Ask in Streamlit Community Forum

**Dashboard has errors?**
1. Add try/except blocks around visualizations
2. Use sample data instead of loading files
3. Add "Demo Mode" warning banner
4. Focus on working pages, hide broken ones

**Still stuck?**
- Streamlit Discord: https://discord.gg/streamlit
- Railway Discord: https://discord.gg/railway
- Or ask: "How do I fix [specific error]?"

**Remember:** A live demo with minor imperfections beats a perfect local demo you can't share.
