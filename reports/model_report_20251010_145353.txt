CLAIMS CONTRIBUTION
Total: 26.7%
- Outpatient: 16.4%
- Inpatient: 9.0%
- Comorbidities: 1.2%

KEY INSIGHTS
1. Claims data IS predictive (26.7% of model importance)
2. Outpatient patterns > Inpatient patterns (16.4% vs 9.0%)
3. Geographic factors matter significantly (57.4%)
4. Comorbidity count is top predictor (32.8%)
5. Model achieves excellent discrimination (ROC-AUC 0.873)

BUSINESS VALUE
- Can identify high-risk members for targeted intervention
- Top 10% risk tier shows 6-10x enrichment vs random selection
- 499 high-risk members in test set (score >= 0.292)
- Outpatient cost patterns are strongest claims predictors

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Use for risk stratification (not binary classification)
2. Target top 10-20% risk members (>= 0.292)
3. Focus on outpatient utilization patterns
4. Investigate geographic disparities
5. Add pharmacy data in future iterations
6. Validate on real-world dataset with normal GSD rates

LIMITATIONS
1. Extreme class imbalance (0.5% compliant vs typical 60-70%)
2. Low recall (18.5%) - misses many compliant members
3. Dataset may have quality issues
4. Requires validation on real-world data

CONCLUSION
The model successfully demonstrates that claims data (inpatient, outpatient,
and comorbidity patterns) are predictive of HEDIS GSD compliance, contributing
26.7% of total predictive power. The model achieves excellent discrimination
(ROC-AUC 0.873) and can be used for risk stratification to prioritize
care management interventions.
