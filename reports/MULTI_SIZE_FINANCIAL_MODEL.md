| **1M** | $9.7M | $485.2M | $475.5M | **4,902%** |

### Per-Member Economics (Annual at Maturity)

| Plan Size | Annual Value | Per-Member Value | Per-Member Cost |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **25K** | $5.66M | **$226** | $5 |
| **50K** | $11.33M | **$227** | $4 |
| **100K** | $22.64M | **$226** | $4 |
| **250K** | $41.6M | **$166** | $3 |
| **500K** | $73.2M | **$146** | $2 |
| **1M** | $126.4M | **$126** | $2 |

**Key Insight:** Smaller plans actually achieve **HIGHER** per-member value ($226-227) due to more efficient targeting of high-risk populations. Larger plans benefit from economies of scale in implementation costs.

## Scaling Insights

### What Changes with Scale?

#### ✅ **Scale-Dependent (Linear)**
1. **Gap Closure Revenue** - Directly proportional to population
2. **Implementation Staff** - Scales with member volume
3. **Infrastructure Costs** - Grows with data processing needs

#### ✅ **Scale-Independent (Fixed)**
1. **Development Costs** - One-time investment ($50K regardless of size)
2. **Model Training** - Same ML pipeline for all sizes
3. **Clinical Logic** - HEDIS rules don't change by plan size

#### ✅ **Sub-Linear Scaling (Economies of Scale)**
1. **HEI Protection Value** - Larger plans face higher equity scrutiny but benefit from pooled risk
2. **Per-Member Costs** - Decreases from $5 to $2 as volume increases
3. **Maintenance Burden** - Shared infrastructure supports more members

- Top 10 payers
- Multi-line carriers

**Advantages:**
- **Massive** absolute returns ($270M-$476M)

| **HEI Score** | 85 | 77 (-9%) | 3,000% → 2,400% | 93 (+9%) | 3,000% → 3,600% |
| **Implementation Cost** | $970K | $873K (-10%) | 3,270% → 3,633% | $1.07M (+10%) | 3,270% → 2,973% |
| **Star Rating** | 5.0 | 4.5 (-10%) | 3,000% → 2,500% | 5.0 (max) | No change |

**Conclusion:** ROI remains **>2,400% in ALL scenarios**, demonstrating robust value proposition.

## Recommended Approach by Plan Size

### Immediate Implementation (All Sizes)
1. **Start with Tier 1 (Diabetes)**
   - Fastest time to value
   - Highest Star Rating weight
   - Proven success patterns

2. **Add HEI Framework Early**
   - 2027 mandate compliance
   - Protects existing revenue
   - Competitive differentiator

### Phased Expansion
