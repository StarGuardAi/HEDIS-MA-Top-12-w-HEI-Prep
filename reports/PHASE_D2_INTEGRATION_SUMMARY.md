## 📝 Technical Notes

### Database Design Decisions

**Why Graceful Degradation?**
- API continues working if database unavailable
- Predictions still generated, just not persisted
- Allows testing without database setup
- Improves reliability

**Why Separate CRUD Module?**
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Easier to test database operations
- Reusable across API endpoints
- Follows repository pattern

**Why Try-Except for Database Saves?**
- Don't fail predictions if database down
- Log warnings for monitoring
- Graceful degradation strategy
- Better user experience

### Performance Considerations

**Database Connection Pooling:**
- Min: 5 connections (always available)
- Max: 20 connections (burst capacity)
- Timeout: 30 seconds
- Recycle: 1 hour (prevent stale connections)

**Query Optimization Strategy:**
- Index all foreign keys
- Composite indexes for common queries
- Partial indexes for status-based queries
- JSONB indexes for measure lookups

**Partitioning Strategy:**
- Monthly partitions for api_logs and audit_log
- Automatic partition creation
- Improves time-based query performance
- Simplifies data archiving

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Models Not Loaded:** Prediction endpoints return 503 if models missing
   - **Status:** Expected (Phase D.1 limitation)
   - **Workaround:** Use demo mode

2. **Database Optional:** Database persistence is optional
   - **Status:** By design (graceful degradation)
   - **Impact:** Predictions work but not persisted

3. **Alembic Migrations Not Run:** Initial schema not created yet
   - **Status:** Pending database availability
   - **Next:** Run `alembic upgrade head` when DB available

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Async database operations (asyncpg)
- [ ] Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Read replicas for analytics queries
- [ ] Automated partition maintenance
- [ ] Advanced query optimization
