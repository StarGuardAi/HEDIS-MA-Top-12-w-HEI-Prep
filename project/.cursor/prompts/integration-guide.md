## 🔧 Method 1: Master .cursorrules File (RECOMMENDED)

**Best for:** Automatic integration - Cursor loads this on every chat

### Step 1: Create Your Master .cursorrules File

Create a file named `.cursorrules` in your project root:

```markdown
# HEDIS GSD Prediction Engine - Cursor AI Rules
# This file is AUTOMATICALLY loaded by Cursor AI in every conversation

---

## 🎯 WORKFLOW: Always Follow These Steps

### 1. PLAN PHASE
Before writing any code:
1. Read Plan.md to understand the current phase
2. Check tasks/todo.md for the current task
3. Create a detailed task breakdown
4. Save the plan to tasks/todo.md
5. **STOP and wait for human verification**

### 2. IMPLEMENTATION PHASE
After plan approval:
1. Make simple, minimal changes (impact as little code as possible)
2. Provide high-level explanations of changes
3. Mark todo items as complete: `- [x] Task description`
4. **After every file/module completion, run code reviews**

### 3. REVIEW PHASE (CRITICAL - Healthcare Compliance)
After writing code, ALWAYS run these reviews in order:

**For ALL Python code:**
```
/review-security [filename]
/review-hipaa [filename]
/review-performance [filename]
```

**For data processing code:**
```
/review-data-quality [filename]
```

**For SQL queries:**
```
/review-sql [filename]
```

**For ML model code:**
```
/review-model-code [filename]
/review-clinical-logic [filename]
```

**For API code:**
```
/review-security [filename]
/review-gen-ai [filename]  # If using LLMs
```

### 4. COMPLETION PHASE
1. Run pre-commit checks: `bash scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh`
2. Update tasks/todo.md with review section
3. Summarize changes in simple terms
4. Archive completed task to tasks/completed/

## 🏥 HEALTHCARE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### Always Consider (HIPAA Compliance)
- **PHI Handling:** Never log, print, or expose patient identifiers
- **De-identification:** Use Safe Harbor or Expert Determination methods
- **Audit Logging:** Log all access to patient data with timestamps
- **Data Minimization:** Only process necessary fields
- **Encryption:** Ensure data at rest and in transit is encrypted

### Clinical Validation Requirements
- **ICD-10 Codes:** Validate against current year code set
- **HEDIS Measures:** Follow NCQA specifications exactly
- **Age Calculations:** Use index date from HEDIS specs
- **Date Logic:** Handle multiple encounters and service dates correctly
- **Exclusions:** Apply HEDIS exclusion criteria (hospice, SNP, etc.)

### Model Development Standards
- **Temporal Validation:** Train on past years, test on future year
- **No Data Leakage:** Ensure outcome variable not in features
- **Fairness Metrics:** Report performance across age, gender, race
- **Interpretability:** Provide SHAP values for all predictions
- **Clinical Thresholds:** Document source for all cutoff values

## 💻 CODE REVIEW COMMANDS (Reference: .cursor/prompts/code-review.md)

### Quick Reference
| Command | Use Case | Files |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `/review-security` | PHI exposure, SQL injection, API keys | All Python/SQL |
| `/review-hipaa` | HIPAA compliance check | Data processing, APIs |
| `/review-performance` | Optimization for large datasets | ETL, queries |
| `/review-data-quality` | Null handling, outliers, types | Feature engineering |
| `/review-clinical-logic` | HEDIS specs, ICD-10, calculations | Model features, business rules |
| `/review-model-code` | Bias, leakage, validation | ML training, evaluation |
| `/review-sql` | Query optimization for EHR data | All SQL files |

### How to Use Commands
1. Select code in editor (or specify filename)
2. Open Cursor chat (Cmd/Ctrl + L)
3. Type the command: `/review-security src/data/data_loader.py`
4. Review findings and fix issues
5. Re-run command to verify fixes

## 📋 SIMPLIFIED WORKFLOW EXAMPLE

### Example: Implementing Feature Engineering (Phase 1.1)

**Step 1: Plan** (You do this first)
```
Task: Create feature_engineering.py with HEDIS GSD-specific features

Subtasks:
1. [ ] Load processed claims data
2. [ ] Calculate age at measurement year end
3. [ ] Create diabetes comorbidity flags (CKD, CVD, retinopathy)
4. [ ] Calculate HbA1c test frequency features
5. [ ] Create utilization features (ED visits, hospitalizations)
6. [ ] Validate features match HEDIS specifications
```

**Step 2: Implementation** (Cursor AI does this)
```python
# src/data/feature_engineering.py
# Cursor creates the code with inline comments
def create_hedis_gsd_features(claims_df, lab_df, member_df):
    """
    Create features for HEDIS GSD (Glycemic Status Diabetes) prediction.
    
    HEDIS Specification: MY2023 Volume 2
    Measure: HBD - Hemoglobin A1c Control for Patients with Diabetes
    """
    # Implementation here...
```

**Step 3: Review** (Cursor AI does this automatically)
```
User → Cursor Chat:
"I've just completed feature_engineering.py. 
Run these reviews:
/review-security src/data/feature_engineering.py
/review-hipaa src/data/feature_engineering.py
/review-clinical-logic src/data/feature_engineering.py
/review-performance src/data/feature_engineering.py"
```

**Cursor's Review Output:**
```
✅ /review-security: PASSED
  - No PHI in logs or print statements
  - No hardcoded credentials

⚠️  /review-hipaa: 1 MEDIUM issue
  - Line 45: Consider hashing member_id before logging
  - Recommendation: Use SHA-256 hash for audit logs

✅ /review-clinical-logic: PASSED
  - Age calculation uses HEDIS measurement year end (Dec 31)
  - ICD-10 codes match HEDIS diabetes value set
  - Comorbidity definitions align with CMS-HCC model

⚠️  /review-performance: 1 HIGH issue
  - Line 78: DataFrame iterrows() detected
  - Recommendation: Use vectorized operations or apply()
```

**Step 4: Fix Issues**
```python
# BEFORE (from review)
for idx, row in claims_df.iterrows():
    member_id = row['member_id']
    logger.info(f"Processing member {member_id}")  # PHI exposure!

# AFTER (fixed)
claims_df['member_hash'] = claims_df['member_id'].apply(
    lambda x: hashlib.sha256(str(x).encode()).hexdigest()[:8]
)
logger.info(f"Processing {len(claims_df)} member records")
```

**Step 5: Complete**
```
- [x] Create feature_engineering.py
  - Review Results: 
    - Security: PASSED
    - HIPAA: PASSED (after fixes)
    - Clinical Logic: PASSED
    - Performance: PASSED (after vectorization)
  - Changes: 
    - Implemented 25 HEDIS-aligned features
    - Added member_id hashing for audit logs
    - Vectorized DataFrame operations for 10x speedup
```

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Cursor doesn't seem to follow .cursorrules"
**Solution:** 
1. Close and reopen Cursor
2. Check file is named exactly `.cursorrules` (with leading dot)
3. Verify it's in project root (same level as Plan.md)
4. Try: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P → "Reload Window"

### Issue: "Code review commands not working"
**Solution:**
1. Commands are **custom prompts**, not built-in
2. Manually type the full review prompt, e.g.:
   ```
   Review this code for security vulnerabilities:
   - Check for PHI exposure in logs
   - Check for SQL injection in queries
   - Check for hardcoded credentials
   
   File: src/data/data_loader.py
   ```

### Issue: "Too many review steps, slowing down"
**Solution:**
1. For quick prototypes, skip reviews
2. Run reviews only at task completion
3. Batch multiple files: `/review-security src/data/*.py`

### Issue: "Reviews find issues but I don't understand the fix"
**Solution:**
Ask Cursor to explain:
```
"You found a PHI exposure issue on line 45. 
Please explain:
1. Why is this a HIPAA violation?
2. What's the security risk?
3. Show me the corrected code with explanation
Act like you're a senior engineer teaching me."
```

## ✅ NEXT STEPS

1. **Copy this entire guide** to a new file: `.cursor/prompts/integration-guide.md`

2. **Create your .cursorrules** file using the master template above

3. **Test it** by starting a new Cursor chat:
   ```
   "I want to start Phase 1.1 of my HEDIS GSD project. 
   Create the task breakdown in tasks/todo.md and wait for my approval."
   ```

4. **Verify it works** - Cursor should:
   - Read Plan.md
   - Create detailed subtasks
   - **STOP and wait** for your verification
   - Only proceed after you approve

5. **Report back** - Tell me if it works or if you need adjustments!
