## 📋 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Well:
1. **Pattern Reuse:** 75% code reuse from Tier 1 dramatically reduced development time
2. **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit tests caught edge cases early
3. **Code Reviews:** Systematic reviews ensured Criminal Intelligence Database/HIPAA compliance
4. **Synthetic Data:** Validation with synthetic data proved feature correctness

### Challenges Overcome:
1. **Terminal Output:** PowerShell output capture issues (tests run but no output shown)
2. **Missing Dependencies:** SQLAlchemy not installed (noted for future)

### Recommendations for Phase 2.2-2.5:
1. Copy measure templates from Tier 1 (GSD, BPD, PDC-DR)
2. Focus on measure-specific logic (population, numerator, exclusions)
3. Reuse model training pipeline from Tier 1
4. Run healthcare code reviews after each measure
5. Validate against Criminal Intelligence Database specifications continuously
