  - eGFR (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate) - kidney function
  - UACR (Urine Albumin-Creatinine Ratio) - kidney damage
  - Must have BOTH in measurement year to count
- 🎯 **Critical Gap Analysis - THE KEY INSIGHT:**
  - **eGFR-Only Segment = QUICK WIN OPPORTUNITY**
  - Most members have eGFR (part of basic metabolic panel)
  - Missing UACR (requires specific urine test order)
  - **Simple intervention:** Order UACR test → instant compliance
  - **Expected conversion:** 60-80% with proactive outreach
  - **ROI:** 400%+ (low intervention cost, high value)
- 💡 **Priority Interventions:**
  - eGFR-Only (HIGH priority): EMR alerts, standing orders, in-home UACR kits
  - Untested (MEDIUM priority): Standard outreach, lab partnerships
- 🏥 **Clinical Importance:**
  - 1 in 3 adults with diabetes has CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease)
  - Early detection can slow/prevent ESRD (dialysis/transplant)
  - CKD staging breakdown visualization

---

### Option 2: **Move to Phase C (Testing)**
**Time Required:** 4-6 hours

**Rationale:** 
- 4 highest-value pages already complete (HEI + 3 triple-weighted)
- Can demonstrate core functionality without all 12 pages
- Testing ensures quality before adding more pages

**Tasks:**
1. Fix 43 failing measure tests (3-4 hours)
2. Add integration tests for API workflows (1 hour)
3. Improve test coverage to 95%+ (1-2 hours)

**Trade-off:** Dashboard incomplete, but testing ensures production readiness

---

### Option 3: **Hybrid Approach**
**Time Required:** 5-6 hours total

**Tasks:**
1. Complete CBP dashboard (45 min) → completes all triple-weighted measures
2. Complete medication adherence trio (2 hours) → high-value, common pattern
3. Integrate 8 completed pages into multi-page app (1 hour)
4. Move to Phase C: Testing (3-4 hours)

**Deliverable:** 8 of 12 measures complete + testing foundation

---

## 💡 **RECOMMENDATION**

**Proceed with Option 1: Complete Phase B**

**Rationale:**
1. **Completeness:** All 12 measures demonstrates full implementation
2. **Momentum:** Pattern established, remaining pages follow template
3. **Presentation:** Complete dashboard more impressive for influencers
4. **Time Investment:** Only 3-4 hours to finish vs starting over in Phase C
5. **Integration:** Multi-page app setup required eventually anyway

**Estimated Total Project Time Remaining:**
```
Phase B Remaining: 3-4 hours
Phase C (Testing): 4-6 hours
Phase D (Code Review): 2-3 hours
Phase E (Deployment): 3-4 hours
Phase F (Job Package): 2-3 hours
────────────────────────────────
TOTAL REMAINING: 14-20 hours (2-3 full days)
```

**Target Completion:** Within 3 business days with focused effort
