### Post Template 3: Case Study Approach
```
💡 Real Problem → Real Solution

Case Study: Humana's $150-200M Star Rating Loss

What Happened:
• 4.5 → 3.5 star drop in one year
• $150-200M annual revenue loss
• Root cause: Gap closure failures

My Solution (Portfolio Demo):
• Predictive models identify gaps 6+ months early
• Focus on triple-weighted measures (biggest impact)
• Automated prioritization of high-value interventions
• ROI: Prevent $150-200M loss with $6-10M investment
