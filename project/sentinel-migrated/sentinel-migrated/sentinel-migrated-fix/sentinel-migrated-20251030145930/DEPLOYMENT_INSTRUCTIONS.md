Subject: Portfolio Demo - HEDIS Star Rating Specialist

Hi [Recruiter Name],

I've built a complete HEDIS portfolio system that addresses the 
exact challenges Humana (H5216) and Centene are facing with Star Ratings.

Live demo: https://bobareichert-hedis-portfolio.streamlit.app

The portfolio includes:
- 12 predictive models (91% avg accuracy)
- Crisis prevention strategies
- $13-27M annual value projections
- Health Equity Index compliance

I'm seeking AI Support or HEDIS Data Specialist roles where I can 
help prevent similar Star Rating crises.

Best regards,
