## ‚úÖ What We Already Have (Reusable)

1. ‚úÖ **Diabetes features** (`src/data/features/diabetes_features.py`) - 40+ features
2. ‚úÖ **Model training pipeline** (`src/models/ked_trainer.py` pattern)
3. ‚úÖ **Prediction interface** (`src/models/ked_predictor.py` pattern)
4. ‚úÖ **Testing patterns** (unit tests, integration tests)
5. ‚úÖ **Documentation templates** (from KED)
6. ‚úÖ **Healthcare compliance patterns** (all 6 reviews)

---

## üöÄ What We Need to Build (NEW)

### 1. EED Measure Logic (`src/measures/eed.py`) - ~400 lines
- Denominator identification (age + diabetes)
- Exclusions application (hospice, frailty)
- Numerator calculation (eye exam CPT codes)
- Gap analysis (no eye exam in measurement year)
- Individual-level results

### 2. Procedure Data Loader (`src/data/loaders/procedure_loader.py`) - ~350 lines
- Load procedure/CPT codes from claims
- Filter by CPT/HCPCS codes
- Aggregate by individual and service date
- Support multiple procedure types (eye exams, mammography, colonoscopy)
- **Bonus:** Will support BCS (mammography) and COL (colonoscopy) in Tier 3

### 3. EED Unit Tests (`tests/measures/test_eed.py`) - ~300 lines
- Test denominator logic
- Test exclusions
- Test numerator (eye exam identification)
- Test gap analysis
- Test edge cases

### 4. Procedure Loader Tests (`tests/data/test_procedure_loader.py`) - ~200 lines
- Test CPT code extraction
- Test individual-level aggregation
- Test date filtering
- Test multiple procedure types

### 5. Synthetic Test Data (`tests/fixtures/synthetic_eed_data.py`) - ~300 lines
- Compliant individuals (with eye exams)
- Gap individuals (no eye exams)
- Excluded individuals (hospice)
- Edge cases

## üìã Implementation Checklist

### Task 1: Create Procedure Data Loader (~30 min)
- [ ] Create `src/data/loaders/procedure_loader.py`
- [ ] Implement CPT/HCPCS code extraction
- [ ] Individual-level aggregation
- [ ] Date filtering
- [ ] Support multiple procedure types (eye, mammo, colonoscopy)
- [ ] PHI-safe logging
- [ ] Documentation

### Task 2: Create EED Measure Logic (~30 min)
- [ ] Create `src/measures/eed.py`
