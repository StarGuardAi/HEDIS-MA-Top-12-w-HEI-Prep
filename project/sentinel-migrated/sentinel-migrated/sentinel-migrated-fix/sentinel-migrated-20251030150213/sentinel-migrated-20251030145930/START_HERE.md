1. Select: **GitHub.com**
2. Select: **HTTPS**
3. Select: **Yes** (authenticate Git)
4. Select: **Login with a web browser**
5. **Copy the code** shown (e.g., `A1B2-C3D4`)
6. **Press Enter** → Browser opens
7. **Paste code** → Click "Authorize"
8. Done! ✅

**Verify:**
```powershell
gh auth status
```

**Detailed guide:** See `AUTHENTICATE_MANUALLY.md` for troubleshooting and alternative methods.

## 🚀 Step 2: Publish Milestones (2 minutes each)

```
publish_all.bat
```

Then run again and enter: **2**

### **Option B: Just GitHub**

Double-click:
```
publish_github.bat
```

Enter milestone: **1**  
Select: **5** (Do everything)

Repeat for milestone **2**

## 📤 Step 3: Push to GitHub (30 seconds)

In PowerShell:
```bash
git push origin main
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**"Not authenticated"**  
→ Run: `authenticate_github.bat`

**"gh not recognized"**  
→ Already fixed! All scripts now include the PATH.

**"Release already exists"**  
→ Releases are only created once per milestone.

---

## ⏱️ Total Time

- Authentication: 2 minutes (one time)
- Publish Milestone 1: 2 minutes
- Publish Milestone 2: 2 minutes
- Push to GitHub: 30 seconds
- **TOTAL: ~7 minutes** to publish both milestones! 🎉
