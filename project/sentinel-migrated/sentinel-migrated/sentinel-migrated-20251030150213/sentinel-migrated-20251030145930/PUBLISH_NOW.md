## 💡 Interview Talking Points (If Posts Lead to Opportunities)

### "Tell me about this project"
**Answer:**
"I built a healthcare AI system that demonstrates modern development practices. What's unique is I used Cursor AI with Claude Sonnet and ChatGPT to accelerate development by 60% while maintaining full HIPAA compliance. The system achieves 91% accuracy predicting diabetic patient risk, and I completed it in 3 weeks versus the typical 8-week timeline. The key was using AI for code generation and compliance checking while I focused on clinical validation and healthcare domain logic."

### "How did you use AI tools?"
**Answer:**
"Strategically. Cursor AI generated about 60% of the boilerplate code - schemas, test fixtures, basic endpoints. Claude Sonnet performed automated code reviews, catching 15+ potential PHI exposure issues. ChatGPT helped me interpret complex HEDIS specifications faster. But I wrote all the clinical logic, validated compliance, and ensured predictions were clinically sound. AI accelerated the 'how,' I ensured the 'what' was correct for healthcare."

### "Why is this relevant to us?"
**Answer:**
"It demonstrates three things: First, I'm proficient with modern AI development tools - Cursor AI, Claude, ChatGPT. Second, I understand healthcare compliance deeply enough to validate AI-generated code for HIPAA and HEDIS. Third, I can deliver production-ready ML systems faster without compromising quality. In healthcare, that's the sweet spot - leveraging AI tools while maintaining the rigor required for patient safety and regulatory compliance."

  - Faster performance
  - Auto-generated OpenAPI docs
  - Built-in async support
  - Perfect for ML APIs

**2. Authentication:**
- ✅ **Start with API Keys** (not OAuth2)
  - Simpler to implement (1 day vs 4 days)
  - Sufficient for pilot deployment
  - Can upgrade to OAuth2 in Phase 5

**3. Database:**
- ✅ **Skip database for Phase 3**
  - Faster development
  - Less complexity
  - Add PostgreSQL in Phase 5 if needed

**4. Deployment:**
- ✅ **Google Cloud Run or AWS Lambda**
  - Serverless (easy scaling)
