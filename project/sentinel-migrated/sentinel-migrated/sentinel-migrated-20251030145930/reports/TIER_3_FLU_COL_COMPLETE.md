## 3. Portfolio Value Summary

### 11-Measure Portfolio Breakdown

## 5. Performance Considerations

Both FLU and COL measures are implemented with performance optimizations:

**FLU:**
- Pre-filter to flu season dates (Oct 1 - Mar 31)
- Check both claims and pharmacy data sources
- O(n) complexity with grouped DataFrames

**COL:**
- Check screening modalities in order of clinical preference
- Early exit on first match (colonoscopy > sigmoidoscopy > CT > FIT > FIT-DNA)
- Pre-filter claims by look-back periods
- O(n) complexity

**Estimated Performance:**
- 100K individuals: ~3-5 minutes per measure
- Combined with Option B optimizations: ~2-3 minutes per measure

## 6. Clinical Implementation Considerations

### FLU Gap Closure Tactics

**High Success Rate Interventions:**
1. **Pharmacy partnerships** (walk-in, no appointment needed)
2. **Mass vaccination clinics** (senior centers, community events)
3. **Provider reminders** (EMR alerts during routine visits)
4. **Individual outreach** (postcards, phone calls in September)

**Expected Improvement:** 15-25 percentage points

### COL Gap Closure Tactics

**Moderate Success Rate Interventions:**
1. **FIT test mail kits** (easiest compliance for non-invasive option)
2. **GI referrals** (colonoscopy scheduling support)
3. **Subject education** (screening benefits, procedure options)
4. **Preference-based outreach** (match modality to subject preference)

**Expected Improvement:** 10-20 percentage points

## 7. Comparison to Industry Benchmarks

### Medicare Advantage Star Ratings (2023)

| Measure | National Average | Top Performers (5-Star) | Our Target |
|---------|-----------------|------------------------|------------|
| FLU | 69% | 80%+ | 75-80% |
| COL | 68% | 76%+ | 72-75% |

**Gap Closure Potential:**
- FLU: Close 500-1,000 gaps → $40K-$80K revenue
- COL: Close 300-600 gaps → $30K-$60K revenue
- **Combined:** $70K-$140K from Tier 3 high-priority measures
