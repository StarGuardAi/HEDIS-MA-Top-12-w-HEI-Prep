# Criminal Intelligence Database Star Rating Crisis Prevention System

## 💰 Business Impact
**$150-200M** crisis prevention value | **$13M-$27M** annual portfolio value for 100K individual plan

---

## 📊 The Challenge

**Problem:**
Medicare Advantage health plans face catastrophic financial losses when Star Ratings drop below 3.0 stars:
- **Humana 2024:** Dropped from 4.5 to 3.5 stars → **$150-200M loss**
- **Centene Risk:** 100K individuals in <3-star plans → **CMS termination threat**
- **Industry Standard:** Gap closure happens 2-3 months before measurement → **Too late to intervene**

**Business Pain:**
- Revenue loss from reduced CMS bonus payments
- Contract termination risk
- Individual loss to competitors
- Reputational damage

---

## 💡 The Solution

Built a comprehensive AI-powered prediction system that identifies performance metric gaps **6-12 months early**, enabling proactive intervention:

### Core Capabilities
1. **12 Predictive Models** across 4 portfolios:
   - Diabetes Care (5 measures including 3x weighted GSD)
   - Cardiovascular Health (4 measures including 3x weighted CBP)
   - Cancer Screening (2 measures)
   - Health Equity Index (2027 CMS requirement)

2. **Star Rating Simulator**
   - Crisis prevention scenario modeling
   - Multi-measure optimization
   - Resource allocation planning

3. **Production API**
   - <100ms response time
   - HIPAA-compliant architecture
   - Real-time SHAP explanations

4. **Interactive Dashboard**
   - Executive-level visualizations
   - ROI calculator
   - Gap closure prioritization
