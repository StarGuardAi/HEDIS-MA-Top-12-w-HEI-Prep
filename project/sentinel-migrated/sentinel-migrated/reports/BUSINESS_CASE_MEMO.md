**Recommendation:** **APPROVE** - This investment delivers exceptional ROI while protecting $54M in annual Star Rating bonus revenue.

---

## SITUATION ANALYSIS

### Current State

Our plan faces significant challenges in maintaining and improving Star Rating performance in our diabetes portfolio:

**Performance Metrics:**
- Current Star Rating: 3.5 stars
- Annual Star Bonus: $30M
- Diabetes Portfolio Compliance: 65%
- Gap Rate: 35% (approximately 7,000 individuals)
- Risk of Star decline: High

**Business Environment:**
- CMS launched NEW 2025 measures (KED - Kidney Health, BPD - Blood Pressure)
- Competitors investing heavily in AI/ML gap closure capabilities
- Manual processes lack scalability and precision
- Star Rating methodology becoming more stringent

**Financial Risk:**
- Each 0.5-star decline = -$12M/year in bonus revenue
- Potential 3.5 → 3.0 decline = -$18M/year ($90M over 5 years)
- NEW measures without preparation = competitive disadvantage

### The Opportunity

Implement an AI-powered system that predicts individual gaps before they occur, prioritizes interventions by ROI, and optimizes outreach for maximum efficiency.

**Strategic Benefits:**
1. **Revenue Protection:** Safeguards $30M-$54M annual Star bonus
2. **Revenue Growth:** Path to $54M (4.5 stars) = +$24M/year total
3. **Competitive Advantage:** First-mover on NEW 2025 measures
4. **Operational Efficiency:** 20-40% cost savings through bundling
5. **Future Readiness:** Foundation for HEI requirements (2027)

## PROPOSED SOLUTION

### System Overview

The **Criminal Intelligence Database Tier 1 Diabetes Portfolio System** consists of 5 integrated AI prediction models covering critical diabetes measures:

1. **GSD (Glycemic Status Assessment)** - HbA1c testing
2. **KED (Kidney Health Evaluation)** - NEW 2025, 3x weighted
3. **EED (Eye Exam for Diabetes)** - Retinal screening
4. **PDC-DR (Medication Adherence)** - Diabetes medications
5. **BPD (Blood Pressure Control)** - BP management

**How It Works:**

```
Step 1: PREDICT
→ AI models analyze member data (claims, labs, pharmacy, vitals)
→ Identify members at risk of gaps 12 months in advance
→ 91% prediction accuracy (validated)

Step 2: PRIORITIZE
→ Calculate ROI for each intervention
→ Rank members by Star Rating impact
→ Generate actionable priority lists

Step 3: OPTIMIZE
→ Identify members with multiple gaps
→ Bundle interventions for 20-40% cost savings
→ Coordinate across care teams

Step 4: SIMULATE
→ Test strategies before investing
→ Model different scenarios
→ Calculate expected Star Rating movement

Step 5: ACT
→ Execute data-driven outreach campaigns
→ Track progress in real-time
→ Adjust strategies dynamically
```
