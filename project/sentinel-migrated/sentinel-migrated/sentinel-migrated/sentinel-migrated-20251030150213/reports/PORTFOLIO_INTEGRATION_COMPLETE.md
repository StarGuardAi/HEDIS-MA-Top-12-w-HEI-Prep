## üîß Portfolio Calculator Updates

### What Was Updated

**File:** `src/utils/portfolio_calculator.py`

#### 1. Measure Weights Extended
```python
MEASURE_WEIGHTS = {
    # Tier 1: Diabetes Portfolio
    "GSD": 3.0,  # Triple-weighted
    "KED": 3.0,  # Triple-weighted, NEW 2025

    "SUPD": 1.0,
    "PDC-RASA": 1.0,
    "PDC-STA": 1.0,
}
```

#### 2. Measure Values Extended
```python
MEASURE_VALUES = {
    # Tier 1: $1.2M-$1.4M total
    "GSD": (360000, 615000),
    "KED": (360000, 615000),

## üí° Key Integration Features

### 1. Unified Portfolio Calculation

**Single System for All 9 Measures:**
- Load predictions from all measures
- Calculate portfolio-level metrics
- Identify multi-measure gaps
- Prioritize interventions by ROI

### 2. Cross-Tier Optimization

**Identify Member Overlaps:**
- HTN + Diabetes (high overlap)
- ASCVD + Diabetes
- Multiple chronic conditions

**Bundled Interventions:**
- Combined lab orders (GSD + KED)
- Multi-measure PCP visits
- Coordinated specialty care

**Cost Savings:** 20-40% through bundling

### 3. Star Rating Impact Analysis

**Portfolio-Level Star Calculation:**
- Weighted average across all measures
- Triple-weighted measures emphasized
- Current vs. potential star rating
- Gap closure scenarios (50%, 100%)

**Example Output:**
```
Current: 3.5 stars (68.5% weighted rate)
With 50% gap closure: 4.25 stars (84.3% weighted rate)
With 100% gap closure: 5.0 stars (100% weighted rate)

Star improvement potential: +0.75 to +1.5 stars
```

### 4. Portfolio Value Tracking

**By Measure:**
- Current value (actual performance)
- Potential value (100% compliance)
- Opportunity value (gap closure potential)

**By Tier:**
- Tier 1 contribution: $1.2M-$1.4M
- Tier 2 contribution: $620K-$930K
- Combined total: $1.82M-$2.33M

**By Weight:**
- Triple-weighted (GSD, KED, CBP): ~60% of value
- Standard weighted (others): ~40% of value

### 5. Member Segmentation

**Segments Generated:**
- **No gaps:** Compliant across all measures
- **Single gap:** One measure gap
- **Multiple gaps (2-3):** Moderate intervention need
- **High gap (4+):** Intensive intervention need
- **Triple-weighted gaps:** Highest priority
- **NEW 2025 gaps:** High priority (KED, BPD)

**Intervention Prioritization:**
1. Triple-weighted gaps first (GSD, KED, CBP)
2. Multiple gaps (bundle opportunities)
3. NEW 2025 gaps (KED, BPD)
4. Single gaps (targeted outreach)
