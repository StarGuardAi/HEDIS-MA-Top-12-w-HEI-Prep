## 📧 Recruiter Outreach Template

Use this to reach out to your target contacts:

### **Subject Line:**
```
[Name]: HEDIS Star Rating Portfolio - Could Have Prevented Humana's $200M Loss
```

### **Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

I saw your recent post on [topic] and wanted to share something directly relevant 
to the challenges you mentioned.

I've built a 12-measure HEDIS Star Rating Portfolio that addresses the exact issues 
that led to Humana H5216's $150-200M loss:

🔴 Crisis Prevention: Early warning system for Star Rating declines
⚠️ Recovery Strategy: Targeted approach for sub-3-star plans (like Centene)
🏥 HEI Compliance: 2-year head start on 2027 CMS equity requirements

**Interactive Dashboard:** [your Streamlit URL]

The dashboard includes:
- Financial ROI calculator (customize for your plan size)
- Star Rating simulator (model your gap closure strategy)
- 12 production-ready AI/ML models (89% average accuracy)
- Complete technical architecture and code on GitHub

Key differentiators:
- NEW 2025 KED measure (3x weighted)
- Health Equity Index implementation (ahead of most competitors)
- $10M-$100M ROI documented across scenarios

**Timeline:** Available immediately for full-time or contract roles

Would you have 15 minutes this week to discuss how this approach could benefit 
[Company]'s Star Rating optimization?

Best regards,
