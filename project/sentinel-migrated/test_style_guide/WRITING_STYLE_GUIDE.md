## ✍️ Writing Guidelines

### Sentence Structure

**DO:**
- Use active voice: "The system identifies threats" (not "Threats are identified by the system")
- Keep sentences clear and concise (15-25 words average)
- Vary sentence length for readability
- Lead with the most important information

**DON'T:**
- Use passive voice unnecessarily
- Create run-on sentences (over 35 words)
- Start multiple consecutive sentences the same way
- Bury key points in complex sentence structures

### Paragraph Structure

**Structure:**
1. **Topic sentence** - States main point
2. **Supporting sentences** - Provide evidence or detail
3. **Concluding sentence** - Reinforces or transitions

**Length:** 3-5 sentences per paragraph (50-100 words)

**Example:**
> Our procurement fraud detection system analyzes bidding patterns across multiple contracts. By examining vendor relationships, timing correlations, and price anomalies, the system identifies collusive behavior. This automated analysis enables early intervention before significant losses occur.

### Punctuation & Formatting

#### Commas
- Use after introductory phrases: "During the investigation, we discovered..."
- Separate items in lists: "The system tracks vendors, contracts, and payments"
- Before conjunctions in compound sentences: "The alert was triggered, and the analyst reviewed the data"

#### Dashes
- Use em dashes (—) for emphasis: "The key finding—identified through pattern analysis—was the timing correlation"
- Use en dashes (–) for ranges: "Coverage spans 2019–2023"

#### Quotation Marks
- Use double quotes for direct quotes: "The system identified $2.3M in suspicious activity"
- Use single quotes for terms or emphasis: "The 'phantom vendor' pattern was detected"

#### Numbers
- Spell out one through nine; use numerals for 10+
- Use numerals for percentages, dates, measurements: "3 percent", "December 15, 2023", "5 meters"
- Format large numbers: "$2.3M" or "$2,300,000" (be consistent)

### Technical Writing

#### Code Examples
- Always include language specification: ```python
- Provide context before code blocks
- Explain what the code does
- Include expected outputs when helpful

#### API Documentation
- Use consistent formatting: `endpoint_name(param_type)` 
- Document all parameters
- Include request/response examples
- Note error conditions

#### Terminology
- Define acronyms on first use: "Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD)"
- Use consistent terms throughout document
- Reference glossary for definitions
