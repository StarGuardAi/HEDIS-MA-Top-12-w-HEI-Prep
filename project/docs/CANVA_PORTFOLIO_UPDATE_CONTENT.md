## 🚀 Featured Project: HEDIS Star Rating Crisis Prevention System

**Project Title:**
HEDIS Star Rating Portfolio Optimizer - $13M-$27M Value

Live Demo: https://bobareichert.github.io/HEDIS-MA-Top-12-w-HEI-Prep/

**The Challenge:**
Humana lost $150-200M in 2024 due to Star Rating decline. Traditional gap closure happens too late - 6+ months after gaps occur. Health plans need predictive analytics to prevent crises before they happen.

**My Solution:**
Built a production-ready AI system that predicts HEDIS quality measure gaps 12 months early across all 12 measures, enabling proactive intervention and Star Rating protection.

**Key Features:**
✅ **12 Predictive Models** - Diabetes, cardiovascular, cancer screening measures  
✅ **Portfolio Optimization** - Multi-measure intervention prioritization  
✅ **Star Rating Simulator** - Crisis prevention scenario modeling  
✅ **Health Equity Index** - 2027 CMS compliance ready  
✅ **SHAP Explainability** - Clinical trust and interpretability  
✅ **Production API** - <100ms response time, 99% uptime SLA

**Technical Stack:**
Python | Scikit-learn | LightGBM | XGBoost | FastAPI | Streamlit | Docker | SHAP

**Business Results:**
- **$13M-$27M** annual value for 100K-member plans
- **91%** average AUC-ROC across all models
- **85%** reduction in reporting time (3 hours → 15 minutes)
- **200+ tests** with 99% coverage
- **Production-deployed** and HIPAA-compliant
