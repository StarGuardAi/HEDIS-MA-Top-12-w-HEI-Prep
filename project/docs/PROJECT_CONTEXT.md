# HEDIS GSD Prediction Engine - Project Context

## üéØ Project Overview
**Goal:** Build a production-ready AI system for predicting diabetic patients at risk of poor glycemic control to improve HEDIS GSD measure performance.

**Business Impact:** 
- Potential value: $50-80M for health plans
- Target: Improve HEDIS GSD measure performance
- Focus: Identify high-risk members for intervention

## üìä Current State
- **Model Performance:** AUC-ROC = 0.91 on test set
- **Features:** 25 engineered features (demographics, comorbidities, utilization)
- **Data:** Processed population dataset (24,935 diabetic members)
- **Status:** Model trained, need to build production system

## üè• Healthcare Context

### HEDIS GSD Measure (HBD)
- **Measure:** Hemoglobin A1c Control for Patients with Diabetes
- **Denominator:** Diabetic members 18-75 years old
- **Numerator:** Members with most recent HbA1c >9.0% (poor control)
- **Exclusions:** Hospice, SNP, ESRD, Frailty

### Clinical Significance
- **Poor Control:** HbA1c >9.0% indicates high diabetes risk
- **Intervention Target:** Members at risk of poor control
- **Quality Impact:** HEDIS scores affect Medicare Star Ratings
- **Financial Impact:** Star Ratings affect plan reimbursement

### Data Sources (CMS DE-SynPUF)
- **Beneficiary Summary:** Demographics, enrollment
- **Inpatient Claims:** Hospital stays, procedures
- **Outpatient Claims:** Facility services
- **Carrier Claims:** Professional services
- **Prescription Drug:** Medication fills

## üîí Compliance Requirements

### HIPAA Compliance
- **PHI Protection:** No patient identifiers in logs/outputs
- **De-identification:** Use Safe Harbor or Expert Determination
- **Audit Logging:** Track all data access
- **Data Minimization:** Process only necessary fields

### Clinical Validation
- **HEDIS Specs:** Follow NCQA specifications exactly
- **ICD-10 Codes:** Validate against current year code set
- **Age Calculations:** Use HEDIS measurement year end
- **Date Logic:** Handle multiple encounters correctly

### Model Standards
- **Temporal Validation:** Train on past, test on future
- **No Data Leakage:** Outcome variable not in features
- **Fairness Metrics:** Performance across demographics
- **Interpretability:** SHAP values for predictions

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Current Components
- **Models:** `logistic_regression_final.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`
