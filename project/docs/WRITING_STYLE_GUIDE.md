# 📝 HEDIS Project Writing Style Guide

**Complete reference for writing style, tone, and formatting across all project documentation, content, and communications.**

---

## 🎯 Core Writing Principles

### Primary Tone & Voice
**BE:**
- ✅ **Confident** (this is proven, not speculative)
- ✅ **Factual** (let the numbers speak)
- ✅ **Strategic** (frame as leadership opportunity)
- ✅ **Urgent** (but not desperate)
- ✅ **Clear** (avoid jargon)
- ✅ **Professional** (healthcare industry standards)
- ✅ **Quantitative** (focus on measurable business impact)

**AVOID:**
- ❌ Apologetic ("I know this sounds aggressive but...")
- ❌ Over-technical (save for appendix)
- ❌ Defensive (you have all the evidence)
- ❌ Rushing (pause for questions)
- ❌ Generic buzzwords without substance
- ❌ Healthcare jargon without explanation

---

## 📋 Content Standards by Document Type

### 1. Executive Communications

**Structure:**
- Lead with business impact ($13M-$27M value proposition)
- Support with specific metrics and evidence
- End with clear call-to-action

**Language:**
- Use healthcare industry terminology correctly
- Quantify everything possible
- Reference real-world case studies (Humana, Centene)
- Frame technical solutions as business opportunities

**Example Opening:**
> "Our HEDIS GSD prediction engine prevents Star Rating drops that cost $150-200M annually. Based on Humana's 2023 crisis, we've identified the 12 highest-impact measures and built automated early warning systems."

### 2. Technical Documentation

**Code Documentation Standards:**
- All functions have healthcare-context docstrings
- Include HEDIS specification references
- Add clinical validation notes
- Document performance optimization decisions
- Never log raw identifiers (member_id, name, DOB) - hash when necessary
- Validate age using HEDIS measurement year end (Dec 31)
- Avoid iterrows(); prefer vectorization
- Document clinical assumptions with citations to HEDIS Volume 2

**Example Function Docstring:**
```python
def calculate_hedis_age(birth_date: str, measurement_year: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate member age per HEDIS specifications.
    
    HEDIS Requirement: Age calculated as of December 31 of measurement year.
    Reference: HEDIS Volume 2, MY2025, General Guidelines.
    
    Args:
        birth_date: Member birth date in YYYY-MM-DD format
        measurement_year: HEDIS measurement year (e.g., 2025)
        
    Returns:
        Age in years as of December 31 of measurement year
        
    Clinical Context:
        Age stratification affects denominator eligibility for most HEDIS measures.
        Incorrect age calculation can cause audit failures.
    """
```

### 3. LinkedIn Content

**Post Structure:**
- Hook with business impact in first line
- 2-3 supporting points with specific metrics
- Healthcare context and industry relevance
- Professional call-to-action
- 10 hashtags total: 4 core + 6 context-specific

**Core Hashtags (Always Include 4):**
- #HealthcareAnalytics #HEDIS #MachineLearning #ValueBasedCare
- #MedicareAdvantage #StarRatings #PredictiveAnalytics

**Context-Specific Hashtags (Choose 6 based on post type):**

**Technical Posts:** #Python #MLOps #DataScience #HealthTech #ExplainableAI #HIPAA

**Business Posts:** #ACO #MedicareAdvantage #StarRatings #PopulationHealth #QualityMeasures #HealthTech

**Compliance Posts:** #HIPAA #DataPrivacy #HealthcareCompliance #EthicalAI #DataGovernance #HealthTech

**Optimal Posting:**
- Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM
- Wait 48 hours for engagement to stabilize before measuring
- Include contact information footer

### 4. Resume & Professional Materials

**Formatting Standards:**
- Consistent bullet point format
- No typos or grammatical errors
- Professional font (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
- 1-2 pages total length
- PDF format (maintains formatting)
- File name: "Robert_Reichert_Resume_HEDIS.pdf"

**Content Strategy:**
- Lead with $13M-$27M value proposition above-the-fold
- Quantify all achievements with specific numbers
- Include live demo links and GitHub repositories
- Tailor bullets to job description keywords
- Highlight HEDIS/healthcare knowledge for relevant roles

**Bullet Point Formula:**
> [Action Verb] + [Technical Implementation] + [Business Impact] + [Validation/Proof]

**Example:**
> "Developed production ML pipeline for Medicare Advantage gap prediction achieving 91% average AUC-ROC; demonstrated $13M-$27M annual value through ROI modeling and validated approach against real-world Star Rating crisis case studies (Humana, Centene)"
