### Template 2: Health Plan Quality Leader Outreach

**For VP Quality / Director of Quality Measures:**

Hi [Name],

I saw [Company] is focused on improving Star Ratings performance. I recently built an AI system that could have prevented Humana's $150-200M loss by identifying gaps 12 months early.

For a 100K-member plan, the system delivers $13-27M in annual value through predictive gap closure across all 12 HEDIS measures.

Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation about how predictive analytics can protect your Star Ratings?

Best,

## üìà LinkedIn Post Strategy for HEDIS Community

### Post Template: Thought Leadership

**Title:**
The Future of HEDIS: Predictive vs. Reactive Gap Closure

**Content:**
After watching Humana lose $150-200M from Star Rating decline, I analyzed what went wrong.

**The Pattern:**
‚úÖ Gap identified in March
‚ùå Too late to close effectively
‚úÖ Star Rating drops by 1.0
‚ùå Revenue lost: $150-200M

**The Solution:**
I built a predictive AI system that identifies at-risk members 12 months early across all 12 HEDIS measures.

**The Result:**
‚úÖ Gaps identified 12 months ahead
‚úÖ Proactive intervention possible
‚úÖ Star Ratings protected
‚úÖ $13-27M value delivered

For quality leaders at MA plans, this is the difference between crisis and competitive advantage.
