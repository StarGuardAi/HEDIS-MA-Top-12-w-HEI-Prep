Claude rules

1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, create a [todo.md](http://todo.md/) file and add a review section to the [todo.md](http://todo.md/) file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.

Security prompt: Please check through all the code you just wrote and make sure it follows security best practices. make sure there are no sensitive information in the front and there are no vulnerabilities that can be exploited

Learning from Claude prompt: Please explain the functionality and code you just built out in detail. Walk me through what you changed and how it works.
