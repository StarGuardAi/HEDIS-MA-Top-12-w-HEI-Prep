## 💡 **KEY INSIGHTS FROM DASHBOARD DEVELOPMENT**

### Design Patterns That Work
1. **Large Gauge Displays** - Instantly communicate performance status
2. **Color-Coded Priority Segments** - RED (high), ORANGE (medium), GREEN (low)
3. **Interactive Sliders** - Let users model "what-if" scenarios
4. **Quick Win Callouts** - Highlight easy opportunities (e.g., eGFR-only for KED)
5. **ROI Calculations** - Justify every intervention with financial impact
6. **Executive Summaries** - Busy leaders need bottom-line first

### Content Differentiation
Each measure page has **unique clinical insights**:
- **GSD:** Good vs Poor control (bidirectional metrics)
- **KED:** eGFR-only quick win (missing UACR is the gap)
- **EED:** AI-assisted screening game-changer (NEW 2025)
- **HEI:** First-mover advantage (2+ years ahead of mandate)

### Business Value Communication
Every page answers:
1. **What is this measure?** (Clinical definition)
2. **Why does it matter?** (Star rating value + clinical impact)
3. **Where are the gaps?** (Segment breakdown)
4. **What should we do?** (Prioritized interventions)
5. **What's the ROI?** (Financial impact model)
6. **When do we start?** (Implementation timeline)
