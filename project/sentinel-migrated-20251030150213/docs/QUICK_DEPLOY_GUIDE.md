## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Streamlit Cloud Issues

**Build fails with dependency errors:**
```bash
# Make sure requirements.txt includes:
streamlit>=1.28.0
plotly>=5.17.0
pandas>=2.1.0
numpy>=1.24.0

# Commit and push changes:
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Update Streamlit dependencies"
git push origin main

# Streamlit will auto-redeploy
```

**App crashes on load:**
```python
# Check streamlit_app.py for:
# 1. Missing data files - add sample data
# 2. Hardcoded paths - use relative paths
# 3. Environment variables - add to Streamlit secrets
```

**Dashboard shows errors:**
```python
# Add error handling in streamlit_app.py:
try:
    st.plotly_chart(fig)
except Exception as e:
    st.warning(f"Visualization unavailable: {e}")
    st.info("This is a demonstration with sample data")
```

### Railway Issues

**Build fails:**
```bash
# Check that requirements.txt includes:
fastapi>=0.104.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.24.0

# Verify Start Command:
uvicorn src.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

**API returns 503:**
```python
# Check logs in Railway dashboard
# Common issues:
# 1. Models not loading - comment out model loading for demo
# 2. Missing files - ensure all required files in repo
# 3. Environment variables - set in Railway settings
```

**API works but Swagger UI doesn't load:**
```python
# In src/api/main.py, ensure:
app = FastAPI(
    title="HEDIS Star Rating Portfolio Optimizer API",
    docs_url="/docs",  # Swagger UI
    redoc_url="/redoc"  # Alternative docs
)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Make Your Demo Stand Out

**Add a "Demo Mode" Banner:**
```python
# In streamlit_app.py (top of page):
st.info("📊 Demo Mode: Using synthetic HEDIS data for demonstration purposes")
```

**Add Analytics:**
```python
# Track page views (optional):
import streamlit as st
import json
from datetime import datetime

if 'page_views' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.page_views = 0
st.session_state.page_views += 1
```

**Add Contact CTA:**
```python
# At bottom of each page:
st.markdown("---")
st.markdown("### 💼 Interested in this work?")
st.markdown("📧 reichert99@gmail.com | 🔗 [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/rreichert-HEDIS-Data-Science-AI)")
```
