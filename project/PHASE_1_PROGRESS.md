## 🔨 In Progress

### Current Focus: KED (Kidney Health Evaluation)
- **Priority:** Triple-weighted, NEW 2025 measure
- **Value:** $360-615K
- **Status:** Core implementation complete, testing next

---

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate (Days 2-3)
1. **Test KED Implementation**
   - Create synthetic test data for KED
   - Unit tests for denominator/numerator logic
   - Integration test with labs loader
   - Validate against HEDIS specifications

2. **Create Diabetes Feature Engineering**
   - `src/data/features/diabetes_features.py`
   - Shared features for all diabetes measures
   - Demographics, comorbidities, utilization
   - SDOH factors

3. **Train KED Prediction Model**
   - Use GSD feature engineering as template
   - Target: Predict who will/won't get KED tests
   - Target AUC: ≥0.85
   - Model: LightGBM or XGBoost

### Week 1-2: Complete Remaining Tier 1 Measures
4. **EED (Eye Exam for Diabetes)**
   - Implement measure logic
   - Create procedure loader for eye exams
   - Train prediction model

5. **PDC-DR (Medication Adherence)**
   - Implement PDC calculation
   - Create pharmacy loader
   - Train prediction model

6. **BPD (Blood Pressure Control)**
   - Implement BP control logic
   - Create vitals loader
   - Train prediction model (NEW 2025)

### Week 3: Portfolio Integration
7. **Tier 1 Portfolio Analysis**
   - Calculate portfolio performance
   - Cross-measure optimization
   - ROI analysis
   - Star rating simulation

8. **Documentation & Testing**
   - Comprehensive test suite
   - Performance reports
   - Phase 1 completion summary

## 🎯 Tier 1 Diabetes Measure Status

| Measure | Status | Implementation | Model | Tests | Value |
|---------|--------|----------------|-------|-------|-------|
| GSD | ✅ Production | Complete | AUC 0.91 | Passing | $360-615K |
| KED [3x] | 🔨 Implementation | Complete | Pending | Pending | $360-615K |
| EED | 📝 Planned | - | - | - | $120-205K |
| PDC-DR | 📝 Planned | - | - | - | $120-205K |
| BPD | 📝 Planned | - | - | - | $120-205K |

**Completion:** 1/5 measures in production, 1/5 implemented, 3/5 planned

## 💡 Key Insights

### KED Implementation Highlights
1. **NEW 2025 Measure** - Critical to master early
2. **Triple-Weighted** - Equal value to GSD ($360-615K)
3. **Two-Part Numerator** - Requires BOTH eGFR AND ACR tests
4. **Lab-Dependent** - Different from claims-based measures
5. **Gap Analysis Built-In** - Identifies which test is missing

### Technical Decisions
- **LOINC Codes:** Comprehensive set for eGFR and ACR
- **Date Filtering:** Measurement year only (not lookback)
- **Exclusions:** ESRD and kidney transplant (appropriate)
- **Member-Level Results:** Detailed for gap closure targeting

### Next Measure Priorities
1. **EED** - Procedure-based (CPT codes)
2. **PDC-DR** - Pharmacy-based (NDC codes, PDC calculation)
3. **BPD** - Vitals-based (NEW 2025, similar to KED approach)

## 🚀 Momentum

**Phase 0 → Phase 1 Transition:** Seamless  
**Time from Phase 0 complete to first measure implementation:** < 1 day  
**Lines of code added:** 900+ (in 1 session)  

**Architecture Validation:** ✅  
The Phase 0 refactoring is paying off immediately:
- HEDIS specs from central registry
- Clear separation of data loaders
- Measure implementations follow consistent pattern
- Easy to add new measures
