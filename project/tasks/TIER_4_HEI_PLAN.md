# TIER 4: Health Equity Index (HEI) Implementation Plan

**Status:** STARTING NOW - FINAL MEASURE!  
**Timeline:** 2-3 hours  
**Expected Value:** $10M-$20M/year PROTECTION (downside risk mitigation)  
**Strategic Importance:** CRITICAL for 2027 Star Ratings

---

## 🎯 Overview

**Goal:** Implement Health Equity Index (HEI) to complete Top 12 portfolio

**Measures:**
1. **HEI** - Health Equity Index (disparity measurement across all Star measures)

**Why CRITICAL:**
- NEW for 2027 Star Ratings (massive penalty risk)
- Measures health disparities across race, ethnicity, language
- $10M-$20M/year DOWNSIDE PROTECTION
- Plans with poor equity scores lose Star Rating points
- First-mover advantage (few plans ready)

**Expected Time:** 2-3 hours

## 📊 HEI - Health Equity Index Details

### What is HEI?

**HEDIS Specification:** NEW for MY2025, ENFORCED in 2027  
**CMS Requirement:** Mandatory reporting starting 2027  
**Star Rating Impact:** Up to -0.5 stars for poor equity performance  
**Financial Impact:** $10M-$20M/year risk for 100K member plan

### How HEI Works

**Population:**
- ALL Medicare Advantage members
- Stratified by: Race, Ethnicity, Language, SDOH factors
- Applied across ALL Star Rating measures

**Methodology:**
1. Calculate performance on each measure by demographic group
2. Identify disparities (gaps between groups)
3. Calculate equity score (0-100 scale)
4. Apply penalty if equity score below threshold

**Numerator:**
- Equity score ≥ 70 = No penalty
- Equity score 50-69 = Moderate penalty (-0.25 stars)
- Equity score < 50 = High penalty (-0.5 stars)

**Key Measures Evaluated:**
- All diabetes measures (GSD, KED, EED, PDC-DR, BPD)
- All cardiovascular measures (CBP, SUPD, PDC-RASA, PDC-STA)
- All screening measures (BCS, COL)
- Additional quality measures

### Why $10M-$20M Value?

**Downside Protection:**
- Current Star Rating: 3.5 (example)
- Current Bonus: $30M/year
- HEI penalty: -0.5 stars → 3.0 stars
- New Bonus: $18M/year
- **LOSS: $12M/year** if poor equity performance

**With HEI Implementation:**
- Identify disparity gaps proactively
- Target interventions to vulnerable populations
- Maintain equity score ≥ 70
- **PROTECT: $10M-$20M/year** in Star bonuses

**This is RISK MITIGATION, not revenue generation!**

---

### Phase 4.2: HEI Calculator Implementation (60-75 min)

**Create:** `src/utils/hei_calculator.py`

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Load Member Demographics with SDOH**
   ```python
   def load_member_demographics(member_df, sdoh_df):
       # Merge demographics with SDOH data
       # Standardize race/ethnicity codes
       # Flag vulnerable populations
   ```

2. **Calculate Measure Performance by Demographic Group**
   ```python
   def calculate_stratified_performance(measure_results, demographics):
       # For each measure (GSD, KED, EED, etc.)
       # Calculate compliance rate by race/ethnicity
       # Calculate compliance rate by language
       # Calculate compliance rate by SDOH factors
   ```

3. **Identify Disparities**
   ```python
   def identify_disparities(stratified_results):
       # Calculate gap between highest and lowest performing groups
       # Flag measures with >10% disparity
       # Rank disparities by magnitude
   ```

4. **Calculate Equity Score**
   ```python
   def calculate_equity_score(disparities):
       # Weighted average across all measures
       # Triple-weighted measures weighted higher
       # Scale 0-100
       # Apply CMS formula
   ```

5. **Generate Equity Report**
   ```python
   def generate_equity_report(equity_score, disparities):
       # Overall equity score
       # Disparity breakdown by measure
       # Priority interventions
       # Vulnerable population segments
   ```

**Code:** ~500 lines

---

### Phase 4.3: Disparity Analysis & Intervention Recommendations (30-45 min)

**Create:** `src/utils/disparity_analyzer.py`

**Features:**

1. **Identify Root Causes:**
   - Language barriers (LEP members)
   - Access to care (transportation, geography)
   - Health literacy
   - Cultural competency gaps
   - Provider network adequacy

2. **Prioritize Interventions:**
   - Highest impact measures (triple-weighted)
   - Largest disparities (>20% gap)
   - Most vulnerable populations (LIS, dual eligible)
   - Cost-effective interventions

3. **Generate Action Plan:**
   - Targeted member outreach
   - Culturally tailored materials
   - Language-specific resources
   - Transportation assistance
   - Provider training

**Code:** ~350 lines
