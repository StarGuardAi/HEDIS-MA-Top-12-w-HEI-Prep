# TIER 2: Cardiovascular Portfolio Implementation Plan

**Status:** READY TO BEGIN  
**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks  
**Expected Value:** $650K-$1M annual revenue contribution  
**Prerequisites:** âœ… Tier 1 Complete (All infrastructure ready)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Goal:** Implement 4 cardiovascular measures to expand our portfolio from diabetes-only to comprehensive chronic disease management.

**Measures to Implement:**
1. **CBP** - Controlling High Blood Pressure [3x weighted] - NEW 2025
2. **SUPD** - Statin Therapy for Subjects with Diabetes
3. **PDC-RASA** - Medication Adherence for Hypertension (RAS Antagonists)
4. **PDC-STA** - Medication Adherence for Cholesterol (Statins)

**Why This Matters:**
- CBP is **3x weighted** = massive Star Rating impact
- Cardiovascular measures have 40-50% diabetic overlap = reuse existing infrastructure
- Medication adherence (PDC) measures leverage existing PDC-DR logic = fast implementation
- Combined value: $650K-$1M annual (35% of full portfolio)
