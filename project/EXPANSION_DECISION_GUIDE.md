## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: Can I change my mind later?**
A: Yes! The phased approach allows course correction at tier boundaries.

**Q: What if I don't have 8 weeks right now?**
A: Start with Tier 1 only (3 weeks), then expand when you have time.

**Q: Do I need all the data sources?**
A: No, we can generate synthetic data matching HEDIS specifications.

**Q: Can I add more measures later?**
A: Yes! The architecture is designed for easy measure additions.

**Q: What if my job search succeeds before finishing?**
A: Great! Even partial completion (Tier 1) is impressive. You can continue as time allows or pause with what's done.

**Q: Is 8 weeks too long?**
A: You can do Tier 1 only in 3 weeks. Or aggressive timeline (6 weeks) for full portfolio.

**Q: Will this replace my current GSD work?**
A: No! Phase 0 refactors current code into new structure. Everything you've built is preserved and enhanced.
