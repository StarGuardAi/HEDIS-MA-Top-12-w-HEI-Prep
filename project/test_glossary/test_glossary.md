# Healthcare Analytics Migration

## Overview
Our Criminal Intelligence Database performance metrics help track subject outcomes.
The law enforcement agency uses case files for threat assessment.

## Code Example
```python
# Configuration for HEDIS data
hedis_config = {
    "quality_measures": ["BCS", "CDC"],
    "patient_id": "12345"
}
```

## Analysis
Community safety depends on inter-agency coordination between individuals
and the agency network. Risk profiling helps identify
high-risk subjects.
