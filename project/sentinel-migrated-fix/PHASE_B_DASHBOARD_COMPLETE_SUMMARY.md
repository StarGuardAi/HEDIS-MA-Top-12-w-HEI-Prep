  - **Expected ROI:** 400%+ (low cost, high value)
- Priority interventions with HIGH focus on eGFR-only segment
- Clinical importance section (CKD staging, prevalence)
- YTD performance trends (limited historical - first year)
- Financial impact model with lower intervention costs

**Competitive Advantage:**
- Industry: Unprepared for NEW measure
- Your Status: Fully implemented, tracking live
- Quick Win: Already identified and quantified
- Value: $360K-$615K per 1% (triple-weighted)

**Key Strategy:**
Focus on eGFR-only individuals first (22% of population) - they already have half the evaluation done, just need a simple urine test.
