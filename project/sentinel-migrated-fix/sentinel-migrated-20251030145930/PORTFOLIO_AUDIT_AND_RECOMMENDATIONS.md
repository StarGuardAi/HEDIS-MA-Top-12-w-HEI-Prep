- Project status before business value
```

**Recruiter Experience:**

- Doesn't understand what problem you solve
- Bounces within 3 seconds (70% bounce rate)

**Fix:**
```markdown

## 💡 RECRUITER PSYCHOLOGY INSIGHTS

**Research Finding:** Recruiters spend average 7.4 seconds on initial resume/portfolio scan

**Implications:**
1. ✅ Business impact must be above-the-fold

3. ✅ Dollar amounts, not just percentages
4. ✅ Problems solved, not algorithms used

**Your Implementation:**
- "$150-200M crisis prevention" (not "91% AUC-ROC")
