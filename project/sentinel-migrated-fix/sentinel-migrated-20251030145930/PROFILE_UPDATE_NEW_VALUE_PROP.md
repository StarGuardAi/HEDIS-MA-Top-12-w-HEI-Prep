## 🎯 New Value Proposition

**Professional Summary:**
```
I'm a data scientist specializing in Medicare Advantage analytics. I help MA plans 
protect millions in Star Ratings revenue through predictive modeling - specifically 
HEDIS gap closure. My recent diabetes prediction model showed 15-25% improvement 
potential, protecting $500K-1M for a mid-size plan. 

Using Cursor AI and modern LLMs, I deliver in 60-90 days what traditional consulting 
takes 6-12 months and costs 10x more.

**Headline:**
```
Medicare Advantage Diabetes Analytics | Protecting $M in Star Revenue | HEDIS Gap Closure Specialist | Part-Time/Fractional
```

**About Section:**
```
I help Medicare Advantage plans protect millions in Star Ratings revenue through 
predictive modeling for diabetes care gaps.

THE PROBLEM
MA plans are losing 0.5-1.0 stars annually, costing $18M-37M per year. Traditional 
consulting takes 6-12 months and costs $500K-2M. Most focus on single measures.

THE SOLUTION
I focus on the diabetes portfolio - four interconnected HEDIS measures (HBD, KED, 
EED, PDC-DR) worth $620K-$1M in combined value for a 100K-member plan.

Using Cursor AI and modern LLMs (Claude Sonnet, ChatGPT-4), I deliver predictive 
gap closure models in 60-90 days at fractional rates.

RECENT RESULTS
• 91% AUC-ROC predicting poor glycemic control (HBD measure)
• 15-25% improvement in gap closure rates
• $500K-1M protected revenue for mid-size plans
• 60% faster development than traditional methods

DIABETES PORTFOLIO FOCUS
✅ HbA1c Control (HBD) - Triple-weighted, 10-15% population
✅ Kidney Evaluation (KED) - Triple-weighted, NEW 2025
✅ Eye Exam (EED) - Standard, tied to HbA1c outcomes
✅ Medication Adherence (PDC-DR) - Critical for control

WHY THIS MATTERS
• 4 measures > 1 measure (portfolio approach)
• Triple-weighted measures = highest ROI
• Diabetes = 25% of MA members, 50%+ of costs
• KED is NEW in 2025 - early mover advantage

TECH STACK
Python, Cursor AI, Claude Sonnet, ChatGPT-4, scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas, 
SHAP, HEDIS specifications, HIPAA-compliant design

AVAILABILITY
Part-time/fractional consulting for mid-size MA plans (25K-100K members)
60-90 day projects, flexible engagement models

Let's talk if you're facing Star Ratings pressure in diabetes measures.
