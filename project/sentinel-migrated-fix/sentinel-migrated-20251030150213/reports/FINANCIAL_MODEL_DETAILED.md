## üìä Financial Model Assumptions

### Plan Demographics (100K Individuals)
```
Total Enrollment: 100,000 members
Average Revenue per Member: $12,000/year
Total Plan Revenue: $1.2 billion/year
```

### Star Rating Economics (CMS 2025)
```
5.0 stars: +5.0% bonus = +$60M/year
4.5 stars: +4.5% bonus = +$54M/year
4.0 stars: +3.5% bonus = +$42M/year
3.5 stars: +2.5% bonus = +$30M/year
3.0 stars: 0% bonus = $0/year
```

### Tier 1 Diabetes Portfolio
```
Measures: 5 (GSD, KED, EED, PDC-DR, BPD)
Star Rating Weight: 10-12% of total (due to 3x weighting)
Target Population: ~20% of members (diabetes)
Average Gap Rate: 30-40% of eligible
```
