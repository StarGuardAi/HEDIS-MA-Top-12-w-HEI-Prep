## 📈 Usage Example

```python
from src.utils.portfolio_calculator import PortfolioCalculator
from src.utils.cross_measure_optimizer import CrossMeasureOptimizer
from src.utils.star_rating_simulator import StarRatingSimulator
from src.utils.portfolio_reporter import PortfolioReporter

# Initialize components
calculator = PortfolioCalculator(measurement_year=2023)
optimizer = CrossMeasureOptimizer()
simulator = StarRatingSimulator(total_revenue=100000000)
reporter = PortfolioReporter(measurement_year=2023)

# Load measure results
measure_results = {
    "GSD": gsd_results_df,
    "KED": ked_results_df,
    "EED": eed_results_df,
    "PDC-DR": pdc_dr_results_df,
    "BPD": bpd_results_df,
}

# Calculate portfolio
combined_df = calculator.load_measure_predictions(measure_results)
combined_df = calculator.calculate_member_gaps(combined_df)

# Generate portfolio summary
measure_summaries = {code: result["summary"] for code, result in measure_results.items()}
portfolio_summary = calculator.generate_portfolio_summary(
    measure_summaries,
    combined_df
)

# Optimize interventions
priority_list = optimizer.generate_priority_list(
    combined_df,
    eligible_denominators={"GSD": 1000, "KED": 1000, ...},
    top_n=100
)

# Simulate scenarios
star_scenarios = simulator.simulate_gap_closure_scenarios(
    measure_summaries,
    closure_percentages=[0, 25, 50, 75, 100]
)

# Generate reports
