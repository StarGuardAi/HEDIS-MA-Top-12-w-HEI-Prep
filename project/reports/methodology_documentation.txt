DATA QUALITY & ASSUMPTIONS

1. SYNTHETIC DATA LIMITATIONS
   - Dataset: CMS DE-SynPUF (synthetic Medicare data)
   - Known issues: Small compliant sample (137 members, 0.5%)
   - Impact: Observed costs contradicted clinical literature
   
2. EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH
   - Used published cost differentials from peer-reviewed sources
   - Conservative assumptions (lower end of published ranges)
   - Sources:
     * American Diabetes Association (2023)
     * JAMA (2020)
     * Health Affairs (2019)
     * CMS Medicare Cost Reports
     
3. COST ASSUMPTIONS
   - Compliant: $13,500.00 per year
   - Non-compliant: $16,000.00 per year
   - Differential: $2,500.00 per year
   - Basis: 18-20% cost increase for poor glycemic control
   
4. INTERVENTION ASSUMPTIONS
   - Cost: $500 per member per year
   - Improvement rate: 15% (conservative)
   - Basis: Published care management program outcomes
   
5. MODEL PERFORMANCE
   - ROC-AUC: 0.873 (excellent discrimination)
   - Validated on holdout test set (20%)
   - Geographic and clinical factors highly predictive
   
6. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRODUCTION
   - Validate cost assumptions with organizational data
   - Track actual intervention costs and outcomes
   - Build longitudinal compliance dataset
   - Update model quarterly with real results
   - Compare projected vs. actual ROI
   
7. LIMITATIONS & CAVEATS
   - Projections based on literature, not local data
   - Synthetic dataset may not reflect real population
   - Improvement rates may vary by intervention type
   - ROI depends on sustained engagement
   - Geographic patterns need local validation

This methodology is appropriate for proof-of-concept and strategic
planning. Recommend prospective validation study for production deployment.
