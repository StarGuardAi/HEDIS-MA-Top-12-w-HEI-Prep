2. **HEDIS Compliance** ✅ MY2023 Specifications Met
   - All age calculations use Dec 31 reference date
   - All exclusion criteria properly implemented
   - PDC methodology follows HEDIS standards exactly

3. **Risk Stratification** ✅ Added Clinical Value
   - SUPD: Identifies ASCVD status for urgency
   - PDC-STA: Separates primary vs. secondary prevention
   - CBP: Age-based BP thresholds (forthcoming review)

### Technical Strengths

1. **Consistent Architecture** ✅
   - All measures follow identical class structure
   - Shared method naming conventions
   - Predictable return types (tuples and dicts)

2. **Comprehensive Documentation** ✅
   - Detailed docstrings for all methods
   - HEDIS specifications referenced
   - Business value quantified

3. **Type Hints** ✅

## 5. Recommendations for Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Phase 2.3+)

1. **Implement Audit Logging** (HIPAA Enhancement)
   ```python
   # Add to all measure calculations
   audit_log = {
       'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
       'measure': 'SUPD',
       'member_id_hash': hashlib.sha256(member_id.encode()).hexdigest()[:8],
       'action': 'denominator_check',
       'result': 'in_denominator'
   }
   ```

2. **Optimize Performance** (Scalability)
   ```python
   # Pre-group data before member loop
   claims_grouped = claims_df.groupby('member_id')
   pharmacy_grouped = pharmacy_df.groupby('member_id')
   
   for member_id in members_df['member_id'].unique():
       member_claims = claims_grouped.get_group(member_id) if member_id in claims_grouped.groups else pd.DataFrame()
   ```

3. **Run Full Test Suite** (Quality Assurance)
   ```bash
   # Execute all tests with coverage
   pytest --cov=src.measures --cov-report=html tests/measures/
   ```

4. **Integrate into Portfolio Dashboard** (Phase 2.3)
   - Add Tier 2 measures to `streamlit_app.py`
   - Create cardiovascular portfolio page
   - Display aggregated Tier 1 + Tier 2 value ($900K-$1.4M)

### Future Enhancements (Phase 3+)

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Extract code lists to YAML files
   - Support multiple measurement years (MY2024, MY2025, MY2026)
   - Make thresholds configurable

6. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Correlation analysis: CBP control vs. PDC-RASA adherence
   - Predict PDC trajectories based on early fills
   - Identify members likely to switch medications

7. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Predict gap closure probability for care management prioritization
   - Forecast year-end measure rates by Q2
   - Personalized intervention recommendations
