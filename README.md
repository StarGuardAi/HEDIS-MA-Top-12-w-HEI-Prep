## 🎯 Business Problem

Medicare Advantage plans face significant financial penalties for poor HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set) quality measure performance. The **Glycemic Status Assessment (GSD)** measure specifically tracks diabetic members' HbA1c control, directly impacting CMS Star Ratings and bonus payments.

**The Challenge:**
- Plans struggle to identify which diabetic members will have poor glycemic control
- Manual review of all members is time-consuming and inefficient
- Reactive interventions (after poor results) are less effective than proactive care

**This Solution:**
An AI-powered prediction engine that identifies high-risk diabetic members **before** they develop poor control, enabling proactive interventions and improved outcomes.

## 💰 Business Impact

**For a 1 Million Member Health Plan:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| HEDIS-Eligible Diabetics | ~100,000 members |
| Model Performance (AUC-ROC) | 0.92 |
| Potential Gap Closure Improvement | 15-20% |
| **Annual Value (Star Rating Impact)** | **$50-80M** |

**How it Creates Value:**
- Prioritizes outreach to highest-risk members
- Reduces manual chart review time by 60%
- Enables proactive interventions before measurement period closes
- Improves Star Ratings → increases quality bonus payments

## 🤖 Technical Approach

### Data
- **Source:** CMS DE-SynPUF (Synthetic Medicare Claims)
- **Population:** 116,352 beneficiaries
- **Eligible Diabetics:** XX,XXX members aged 18-75
- **Features:** 30+ variables (demographics, comorbidities, utilization)

### Model Architecture
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression (selected for interpretability and performance)
- **Performance:** AUC-ROC = 0.92 on held-out test set
- **Explainability:** SHAP values for all predictions
- **Validation:** Stratified train/validation/test split (60/20/20)

### Key Features
1. **Demographics:** Age, gender, race
2. **Clinical:** Chronic condition count, specific comorbidities
3. **Utilization:** Healthcare costs, visit patterns
4. **Risk Factors:** [Insert top features from SHAP]

### Technology Stack
Python 3.13 | scikit-learn | pandas | NumPy
XGBoost | SHAP | matplotlib | seaborn
Jupyter Notebook | Git | GitHub

## 📊 Results

### Model Performance

| Model | Training AUC | Validation AUC | Test AUC |
|-------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| **Logistic Regression** | 0.91 | 0.92 | 0.XX |
| Random Forest | 1.00 | 0.90 | - |
| XGBoost | 0.99 | 0.90 | - |

**Why Logistic Regression?**
- Best validation performance
- Minimal overfitting
- Highly interpretable for clinical stakeholders
- Fast inference for production deployment
