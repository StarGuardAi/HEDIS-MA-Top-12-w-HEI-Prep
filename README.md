## 💡 Why This Project?

### The Problem
Medicare Advantage plans face a **critical challenge**: Star Ratings directly impact revenue, with each 0.5-star difference worth **$50-200M annually**. After researching the HEDIS/Star Ratings space, I identified three key gaps:

1. **Reactive Crisis Management:** Most plans discover star rating problems **6-9 months too late** - after CMS publishes results, when it's too late to intervene
2. **Siloed Measure Analysis:** Plans analyze HEDIS measures individually, missing cross-measure optimization opportunities (e.g., diabetes eye exam helps both GSD and EED)
3. **Lack of Predictive Analytics:** Traditional approaches rely on historical reporting rather than predicting which members need interventions **now**

### My Approach
**HEDIS Star Rating Portfolio Optimizer** addresses these gaps by combining:
- **Predictive ML Models:** 12 HEDIS measure classifiers (85-91% AUC-ROC) that predict gap-in-care **6+ months early**
- **Cross-Measure Optimization:** Intelligent prioritization algorithms that maximize star impact across all 12 measures
- **Explainable AI (SHAP):** Clinical trust through transparent predictions that healthcare teams can understand
- **Health Equity Focus:** 2027 HEI compliance readiness, addressing disparities 2 years ahead of requirement

### What I Learned
Building this project deepened my skills in:
- **Healthcare Domain Knowledge:** HEDIS MY2025 specifications, CMS Star Ratings methodology, clinical validation
- **Feature Engineering:** Created 95+ clinical features from claims, labs, pharmacy, and SDOH data
- **Imbalanced Learning:** Applied SMOTE and class weighting for rare event prediction (gap-in-care is <10% of members)
- **Full-Stack Healthcare Apps:** HIPAA-compliant architecture, Streamlit dashboards, FastAPI backends
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Understanding of healthcare data governance, PHI handling, CMS requirements

### Key Decisions & Trade-offs

**Decision 1: XGBoost/LightGBM over Deep Learning**
- **Why:** Better interpretability (critical for clinical trust), lower latency for real-time predictions, less data required
- **Trade-off:** Potentially lower accuracy ceiling
- **Result:** Achieved 91% AUC-ROC with interpretable SHAP explanations (deep learning struggled with interpretability)

**Decision 2: Streamlit over React Dashboard**
- **Why:** Faster development for portfolio demonstration, Python-native (no context switching), easier ML model integration
- **Trade-off:** Less customization than React, performance limits at scale
- **Result:** Delivered polished demo dashboard in 27 hours vs. weeks for React frontend

**Decision 3: Cross-Measure Optimization Algorithm**
- **Why:** Maximize star impact by identifying members where one intervention closes multiple gaps
- **Trade-off:** Increased computational complexity
- **Result:** Identified 23% efficiency gain (one intervention closes 2.3 gaps on average)

### Technical Challenges Overcome

#### Challenge 1: Clinical Feature Engineering
**Problem:** HEDIS specifications require complex temporal logic (e.g., "eye exam within 365 days of diabetes diagnosis")  
**Solution:** 
- Built domain-specific feature engineering pipeline (`src/data/feature_engineering.py`)
- Created measure-specific feature extractors (`src/data/features/diabetes_features.py`, etc.)
- Validated against HEDIS MY2025 specifications (`src/utils/hedis_specs.py`)  
**Result:** 95+ clinically-valid features with proper temporal windows

#### Challenge 2: Imbalanced Data (Gap-in-Care < 10%)
**Problem:** Traditional models achieved high accuracy but poor recall (missed most gaps)  
**Solution:**
- Implemented SMOTE oversampling in training pipeline
- Used class weighting (pos_weight=9:1) in XGBoost
- Adjusted decision thresholds using ROC-AUC optimization  
**Result:** 91% AUC-ROC with 85% recall (catches 85% of actual gaps)

#### Challenge 3: Real-Time Prediction Latency
**Problem:** Initial feature engineering took 15+ seconds per member  
**Solution:**
- Cached computed features in SQLite database
- Pre-computed historical patterns in batch jobs
- Optimized Pandas operations with vectorization  
**Result:** <500ms prediction time for individual members

### If I Had More Time

**Next Features:**
1. **Provider Network Analysis:** Identify which providers contribute most to gaps, optimize network quality
2. **Cost Optimization:** Factor intervention costs into prioritization (telehealth vs. in-person)
3. **Member Segmentation:** Behavioral clustering to identify high-risk member profiles
4. **Real-Time Integration:** Webhook APIs for EHR/claims systems to trigger interventions immediately

### Real-World Applicability

This project demonstrates skills directly applicable to:
- **Health Insurance Plans:** Medicare Advantage, commercial plans, Medicaid managed care
- **Healthcare Systems:** ACOs, provider networks, care management organizations
- **Quality Improvement Organizations:** HEDIS consulting, gap closure services
- **Healthcare Analytics Companies:** Population health platforms, care management software
