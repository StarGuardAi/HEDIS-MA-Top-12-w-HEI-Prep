Predictive risk stratification engine for HEDIS Glycemic Status Assessment (GSD) measure using machine learning to improve Medicare Advantage Star Ratings

# HEDIS GSD Prediction Engine

**Predictive Risk Stratification for Glycemic Control in Diabetes Patients**

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict which diabetic members are at risk of poor glycemic control (HbA1c >9.0%), enabling proactive interventions to improve HEDIS GSD measure performance and Medicare Advantage Star Ratings.

## 💰 Business Impact
For a health plan with 1M members:
- Potential annual value: $50-80M through improved Star Ratings
- Target: 15-20% improvement in gap closure rates
- Focus: High-risk member identification for care management prioritization

## 📊 Status
🚧 **In Development** - Phase 1: Core MVP (Week 1-3)

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn, XGBoost
- pandas, numpy
- SHAP for explainability
- Jupyter notebooks

## 📁 Project Structure
Coming soon...
