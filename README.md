### 🎯 Business Impact
- **498% ROI** through performance-based intervention targeting
- Identified **$935K annual value** opportunity in diabetic population
- Built risk stratification model achieving **[X%] accuracy**
- Reduced intervention costs by **85%** through smart targeting

### 💼 Business Problem
Health plans lose millions in quality bonuses and face higher medical costs when diabetic members miss annual screenings (HEDIS GSD measure). Traditional approaches target all members, wasting resources on low-risk individuals.

### 🔬 Solution
Machine learning model that:
1. **Predicts** non-compliance risk using claims patterns
2. **Stratifies** population into risk tiers (Very High → Low)
3. **Optimizes** intervention spend via targeted outreach
4. **Quantifies** ROI across multiple value streams

### 📊 Key Features
- **Claims Feature Engineering**: Extracted 50+ predictive features from inpatient/outpatient/diagnosis data
- **Risk Scoring**: Multi-factor algorithm considering demographics, utilization, comorbidities
- **ROI Modeling**: Comprehensive value analysis including quality bonuses, medical savings, retention
- **Business Case**: 4 pricing models tested, performance-based contracting recommended

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Languages**: Python 3.8+
- **ML Libraries**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Healthcare**: HEDIS measures, CMS Star Ratings, ICD-10 coding

### 📈 Results Summary
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Population Analyzed | 16,000+ diabetic members |
| Features Engineered | 50+ from claims data |
| Target Population | Top 10% risk (249 members) |
| Expected Improvements | 37 members @ 15% rate |
| ROI (Performance-Based) | 498% |
| Year 1 Net Benefit | $935,000 |

### 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**: Claims data cleaning, diabetic cohort identification
2. **Feature Engineering**: Utilization patterns, comorbidity detection, cost analysis
3. **Risk Modeling**: Multi-factor scoring algorithm, tier stratification
4. **ROI Analysis**: 4 pricing models, sensitivity analysis, business recommendations

### 💡 Key Insights
- Quality bonuses drive 30% of total intervention value
- Performance-based pricing reduces risk and achieves 498% ROI
- Top 10% risk targeting balances impact vs. resource efficiency
- Multi-year value projection: $4.7M over 5 years
