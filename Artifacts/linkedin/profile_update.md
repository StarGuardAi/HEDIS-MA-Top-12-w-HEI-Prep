## About Section

**Updated About (2,600 characters):**

```
Data scientist and ML engineer architecting production-scale analytics platforms for homeland security, law enforcement, and financial fraud detection. Committed to supporting federal missions through advanced data science and machine learning.

🎯 CURRENT FOCUS: Sentinel Analytics Portfolio (IN DEVELOPMENT)

I'm developing three production-ready ML platform architectures using public datasets for demonstration purposes:

1️⃣ GUARDIAN - Fraud Detection Platform
• XGBoost + Graph Neural Networks architecture
• Real-time pipeline designed for sub-100ms latency
• SHAP explainability implementation for regulatory compliance
• Training on public financial datasets (PaySim, Credit Card Fraud)

2️⃣ FORESIGHT - Crime Prediction Platform
• Prophet forecasting + DBSCAN hotspot detection framework
• 7-day prediction capability architecture
• Geospatial analytics with Mapbox visualization
• Using public Chicago PD crime data for demonstration

3️⃣ CIPHER - Threat Intelligence Platform
• Autoencoder anomaly detection framework
• IOC tracking from public feeds (OTX, Abuse.ch, PhishTank, NVD)
• MITRE ATT&CK framework integration
• Campaign correlation and threat attribution logic

🏆 DESIGN APPROACH vs Enterprise Solutions:

✅ Open-source architecture as alternative to proprietary systems
✅ Production-ready framework demonstrated with public data
✅ Transparent ML design (SHAP) vs black-box solutions
✅ Scalable microservices architecture
✅ Complete development lifecycle with testing frameworks

🔧 TECHNICAL EXPERTISE:

Machine Learning: XGBoost, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Prophet, SHAP, scikit-learn
Data Engineering: Apache Kafka, PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Redis, Elasticsearch
Backend: FastAPI, Flask, RESTful APIs, GraphQL, microservices architecture
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Plotly, Seaborn, Mapbox, D3.js
Cloud & DevOps: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, CI/CD
Security: NIST, MITRE ATT&CK, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, federal compliance

📊 CAREER TRANSITION: Healthcare → Security Analytics

Former healthcare data analyst specializing in HEDIS quality reporting. Successfully transferred methodologies from quality metrics to threat detection KPIs, HIPAA compliance to NIST security frameworks, and clinical decision support to intelligence fusion.

🇺🇸 MISSION & COMMITMENT:

US Citizen committed to supporting homeland security missions. Eligible for Top Secret/SCI clearance. Dedicated to immigration enforcement, border security, financial crimes, and law enforcement intelligence applications.
