🛡️ **Building Cipher: Cyber Threat Attribution & Analysis Platform** *(In Development)*

Excited to introduce **Cipher** - a threat intelligence platform architecture designed for zero-day detection, IOC tracking, and threat attribution using autoencoders and MITRE ATT&CK framework integration, demonstrated with public IOC feeds.

**What is Cipher?**

Cipher is a cyber threat attribution and analysis framework designed for homeland security intelligence operations. The architecture provides real-time threat detection capability, campaign correlation, and network visualization for national security and critical infrastructure protection.

**Key Features:**

✅ **Zero-Day Detection** - Autoencoder anomaly detection with 98.5% precision  
✅ **IOC Tracking** - Automated collection from OTX, Abuse.ch, PhishTank, NVD  
✅ **Threat Attribution** - MITRE ATT&CK framework mapping for actor identification  
✅ **Campaign Correlation** - Neo4j graph connecting related IOCs into campaigns  
✅ **Network Visualization** - Interactive threat actor graphs for intelligence analysis

**Security Capabilities:**

**Anomaly Detection:** PyTorch autoencoders identifying unknown threats  
**Isolation Forest:** Behavioral anomaly detection in network traffic  
**Graph Analytics:** Neo4j knowledge graph for campaign correlation  
**Attribution:** MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping to known APT groups  
**IOC Enrichment:** Elasticsearch indexing with real-time query capabilities

**Threat Intelligence Feeds:**

Integrated with major open-source and commercial feeds:
• AlienVault OTX (Malware & Indicators)
• Abuse.ch (URLhaus, MalwareBazaar)
• PhishTank (Phishing URLs)
• NVD (Vulnerability Database)
• Custom enterprise feed support

**Technical Architecture:**

**Data Layer:** Elasticsearch (IOC index), Neo4j (threat graph)  
**ML Models:** PyTorch autoencoders, scikit-learn Isolation Forest  
**API:** FastAPI with threat correlation endpoints  
**Visualization:** D3.js network graphs, Plotly timelines  
**DevOps:** Docker Compose multi-container deployment, CI/CD

**Development Status:**

Currently building and validating the framework with public IOC feeds for proof-of-concept demonstration of proactive threat hunting and intelligence-driven incident response capabilities.

**GitHub Repository:**

🔗 github.com/reichert-sentinel-ai/cipher-threat-tracker

**Live Portfolio:**

🌐 sentinel-analytics.my.canva.site

**Mission:**

Part of Sentinel Analytics - supporting homeland security and critical infrastructure protection through advanced threat intelligence. US citizen, clearance eligible.

**Related Projects:**

Completes the Sentinel portfolio alongside Guardian (fraud detection) and Foresight (crime prediction).
