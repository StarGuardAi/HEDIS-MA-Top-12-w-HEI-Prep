🗺️ **Building Foresight: Predictive Crime Intelligence Platform** *(In Development)*

Proud to share my work on **Foresight** - a predictive policing platform architecture designed to forecast crime incidents 7 days ahead using Prophet time-series models and DBSCAN spatial clustering, demonstrated with public Chicago PD data.

**What is Foresight?**

Foresight integrates disparate law enforcement data sources to provide comprehensive crime forecasting, hotspot detection, and patrol route optimization. Designed for multi-agency intelligence fusion and resource allocation.

**Key Features:**

✅ **Crime Forecasting** - Prophet time-series model predicting incidents 7 days ahead  
✅ **Hotspot Detection** - DBSCAN spatial clustering identifying high-crime areas  
✅ **Patrol Optimization** - TSP/VRP algorithms improving officer efficiency by 35%  
✅ **Geospatial Analytics** - Interactive Mapbox visualizations with real-time heatmaps  
✅ **Multi-Agency Fusion** - PostGIS integration for comprehensive intelligence analysis

**Datasets & Scale:**

Demonstrated with public Chicago PD crime data spanning multiple years. The architecture is designed to process geospatial data with sub-second latency for interactive mapping and forecasting.

**Technical Architecture:**

**ML Models:** Prophet (forecasting), DBSCAN (clustering), OR-Tools (optimization)  
**Geospatial:** GeoPandas, Shapely, PostGIS for spatial queries  
**Frontend:** Streamlit dashboard with Mapbox GL JS integration  
**Backend:** FastAPI endpoints with geospatial capabilities  
**Visualization:** Plotly charts, Mapbox density heatmaps, interactive layers

**Production Deployment:**

Containerized with Docker, CI/CD via GitHub Actions, ready for cloud deployment (AWS, Azure, GCP). Comprehensive test suite with pytest and mock data generators.

**Development Status:**

Currently building and validating the framework with public Chicago crime data for proof-of-concept demonstration of predictive resource allocation and patrol optimization capabilities.

**GitHub Repository:**

🔗 github.com/reichert-sentinel-ai/foresight-crime-prediction

**Live Portfolio:**

🌐 sentinel-analytics.my.canva.site

**Mission:**

Part of Sentinel Analytics - supporting law enforcement and homeland security missions through advanced geospatial intelligence. US citizen, clearance eligible.

**Related Projects:**

Also building Guardian (fraud detection) and Cipher (threat intelligence) as part of the Sentinel portfolio.
