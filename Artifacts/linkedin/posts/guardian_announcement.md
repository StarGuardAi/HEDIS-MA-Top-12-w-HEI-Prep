🚀 **Building Guardian: AI-Powered Fraud Detection Platform** *(In Development)*

Excited to share my work on **Guardian**, a production-ready fraud detection platform architecture built with XGBoost and Graph Neural Networks. Currently developing and demonstrating with public financial datasets.

**What is Guardian?**

Guardian is an open-source fraud detection framework designed for government procurement monitoring and financial transaction analysis. The architecture is designed to identify fraudulent patterns including bid rigging, phantom vendors, kickback schemes, and money laundering.

**Key Features:**

✅ **Real-Time Processing** - Apache Kafka pipeline architecture targeting 10K+ transactions/second  
✅ **ML Models** - XGBoost ensemble framework + GCN architecture for fraud ring detection  
✅ **Explainability** - SHAP integration for transparent, regulatory-compliant predictions  
✅ **Graph Analytics** - Neo4j network analysis framework for uncovering complex fraud patterns  
✅ **Production-Ready** - FastAPI backend, Docker containerization, comprehensive testing frameworks

**Design Approach:**

Demonstrating open-source architecture as alternative to enterprise solutions:
• Production-ready framework with public datasets
• Zero cost (completely open-source)
• Designed for scalable processing latency
• Full model transparency vs black-box competitors

**Technical Architecture:**

**Frontend:** React + TypeScript dashboard with interactive visualizations  
**Backend:** FastAPI microservices with PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Redis  
**ML Stack:** XGBoost, PyTorch Geometric, SHAP, NetworkX  
**DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS deployment ready  
**Visualization:** Plotly, Seaborn, Cytoscape.js network graphs

**Development Status:**

Currently building and validating with public financial datasets (PaySim, Credit Card Fraud) for proof-of-concept demonstration.

**GitHub Repository:**

🔗 github.com/reichert-sentinel-ai/guardian-fraud-analytics

**Live Portfolio:**

🌐 sentinel-analytics.my.canva.site

**Mission:**

Built as part of Sentinel Analytics - supporting homeland security and law enforcement missions through advanced data science. US citizen, clearance eligible, committed to combatting financial crimes through AI.

**Next Steps:**

Working on Foresight (crime prediction) and Cipher (threat intelligence) to complete the Sentinel Analytics portfolio. Stay tuned!
