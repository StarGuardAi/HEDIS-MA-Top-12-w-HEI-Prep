Subject: Clinical + AI Approach to HEDIS Gap Closure

Hi Jacqueline,

I've combined clinical HEDIS expertise with AI/ML to build a 
comprehensive gap prediction system. Your clinical perspective 
would be invaluable.

Demo: https://bobareichert-hedis-portfolio.streamlit.app

What makes it clinically relevant:
- SHAP explanations for clinical trust

- Intervention recommendations (not just predictions)
- Bias detection across demographic groups
- Health Equity Index for disparity reduction

Built after seeing Humana's recent Star challenges and Centene's 
termination risks - wanted to create something that prevents 
these crises.

Would love your thoughts on the clinical validity of the approach 
(Model Performance > SHAP Analysis).

Open to opportunities where clinical expertise + AI/ML creates impact.
