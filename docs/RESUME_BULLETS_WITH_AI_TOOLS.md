## üí¨ Interview Talking Points (AI Tools)

### Question: "I see you used Cursor AI and Claude Sonnet. How did that work?"

**Answer:**
"Great question! I used Cursor AI as my primary IDE‚Äîit's like VS Code but with built-in AI. For this healthcare project, I used three AI tools strategically:

1. **Cursor AI** for code generation and boilerplate‚Äîit wrote about 60% of the initial code structure, which I then refined for clinical accuracy

2. **Claude Sonnet** for code reviews‚ÄîI'd ask it to review my code for HIPAA compliance, and it caught several potential PHI exposure issues I might have missed

3. **ChatGPT-4** for understanding HEDIS specifications‚Äîhealthcare has complex regulations, and ChatGPT helped me interpret NCQA guidelines faster

The key was using AI for acceleration while maintaining human oversight for clinical validation and compliance. AI suggested patterns, I ensured they were clinically sound."

### Question: "Isn't using AI tools cheating or less impressive?"

**Answer:**
"Actually, it's the opposite‚Äîit's how modern development works. Think of it like using Excel in finance or CAD in engineering. The question isn't whether you use tools, it's whether you use them effectively.

In this project:
- AI wrote boilerplate and patterns (~60%)
- I wrote clinical logic and compliance validation (~40%)
- I reviewed and validated 100% of the code

The result? I delivered production-ready code with 91% AUC-ROC, 100% HIPAA compliance, and comprehensive testing in 3 weeks instead of 8. That's not less impressive‚Äîit's more efficient while maintaining quality.

Plus, healthcare compliance can't be automated entirely. You need human judgment for clinical validation. AI accelerated the 'how,' I ensured the 'what' was correct."

### Question: "What did you learn about AI-assisted development?"

**Answer:**
"Three key insights:

1. **AI is great at patterns, humans essential for domain expertise:** Cursor AI knew Python patterns, but I had to ensure HEDIS compliance. The combination is powerful.

2. **Use AI for acceleration, not replacement:** I used ChatGPT to understand HEDIS specs faster, but I still needed to validate the clinical logic myself.

3. **Documentation excellence:** Claude Sonnet helped generate comprehensive documentation with healthcare context, which would have taken days manually.

The competitive advantage goes to professionals who can leverage both AI tools AND deep domain knowledge. In healthcare, that's combining Cursor/Claude/ChatGPT with HEDIS expertise and clinical validation."
