## Interview Talking Points

### Technical Deep-Dive:
1. **Feature Engineering:** "I created 25 HEDIS-compliant features from raw claims data, including temporal features like claim frequency, clinical features from ICD-9 codes, and utilization patterns."

2. **Model Selection:** "I chose logistic regression over random forest for production because it offered better interpretability (91% vs 89% AUC-ROC) and clinical stakeholders could understand the coefficient-based predictions."

3. **Data Leakage Prevention:** "I implemented strict temporal validation—training on 2008-2009 data and testing on 2010—to ensure the model would generalize to future years."

### Healthcare Compliance:
1. **HIPAA:** "Every data access was logged with hashed identifiers. No raw PHI in logs, only aggregate statistics. All synthetic test data clearly marked with SYNTH_ prefixes."

2. **HEDIS Alignment:** "I validated every calculation against NCQA HEDIS specifications—age calculations use December 31 measurement year end, diagnosis codes match the approved value sets."

### Business Impact:
1. **ROI Story:** "For a typical health plan with 25,000 diabetic members, this identifies about 6,200 high-risk patients. If interventions succeed for even 30% of those, that's almost 2,000 members avoiding serious complications."

2. **Actionable Insights:** "The SHAP analysis showed CKD was the #1 risk factor, which means care managers should prioritize diabetic patients with kidney disease for nephrology referrals."

## Cover Letter Snippet (Optional)

```
I recently completed development of a HEDIS GSD prediction engine that demonstrates my ability to deliver production-ready healthcare AI solutions. This project achieved 91% AUC-ROC while maintaining full HIPAA compliance and NCQA HEDIS specification alignment—showcasing both my technical ML expertise and healthcare domain knowledge.

The system processes 150,000+ Medicare claims to predict which diabetic patients need proactive intervention, potentially improving outcomes for 1,870-2,493 members. I built the entire pipeline from data engineering through model development, validation, and production deployment, including comprehensive testing, clinical bias analysis, and model interpretability using SHAP.

This project exemplifies my approach: combining technical rigor with healthcare compliance to deliver systems that make a real difference in patient care.
