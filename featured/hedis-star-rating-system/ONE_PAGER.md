# HEDIS Star Rating Crisis Prevention System
## One-Page Executive Summary

---

## 💰 **THE BUSINESS PROBLEM**

**Healthcare Crisis:** Medicare Advantage plans losing $150-200M when Star Ratings drop

**Real Examples:**
- **Humana 2024:** 4.5 → 3.5 stars = **$150-200M revenue loss**
- **Centene 2024:** 100K members in <3-star plans = **CMS termination threat**

**Root Cause:** Traditional gap closure happens 2-3 months before measurement → **TOO LATE**

---

## 💡 **THE SOLUTION**

**AI-Powered Prediction System** that identifies quality measure gaps **6-12 months early**

**What It Does:**
- Predicts which members will fail HEDIS measures (HbA1c tests, BP checks, cancer screening)
- Prioritizes interventions by impact on Star Ratings
- Simulates crisis prevention scenarios
- Provides real-time ML predictions via API

**Coverage:**
- **12 HEDIS measures** across diabetes, cardiovascular, cancer screening
- **4 portfolios** including 2027 Health Equity Index (2 years early)
- **100K+ members** supported per health plan
